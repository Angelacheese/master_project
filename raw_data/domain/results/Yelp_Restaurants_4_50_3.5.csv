yf-Wyt5qEsMVLBOixisskQ,GBTPC53ZrG1ZBY3DT8Mbcw,5,68,"Wow!! I found myself talking about this place all day it's that good!

Stopped in for breakfast.  We received excellent service, coffee was refilled frequently, our order was taken promptly and the food was brought out in a timely manner.

The food was amazing!

Order:

Southern breakfast $15 - 2 eggs, Allan Benton's bacon, housemade andouille sausage, buttermilk biscuit, grits

Side of fruit & berries $6

French press $3.5 (Santa Lucia coffee), free refills.

The coffee tasted great.  

The fruit was fresh and cut into nice size pieces.  It included watermelon; blueberries, honeydew, strawberries, and cantaloupe

The meal was so amazing.  The bacon and the sausage smelled so wonderful, and had a Smokey taste that was out of this world.  The bacon was perfectly crispy, and the sausage was cooked perfectly as well.  It had a bit of spicy to it but was excellent.  The eggs were scrambled and fluffy.  The grits were made with mascarpone and were oh so wonderful. The biscuit was tasty and served with a side of whipped butter and strawberry preserves.

The meal was perfect, service was excellent, and we really enjoyed our visit.

I highly recommend eating here often :)

Hi1ZYFHB3FHrwCUsIfhDUQ,y8R6_RZsBO-b__bJaQjuaw,5,66,"I'm not sure how they pack so many flavors into a thin coating of pastel icing, but Factory Donuts knows their secrets and does a great job keeping their signature roundies beautiful and sweetly refreshing. How will we Newtownians ever leave home now that these pristine creations are living among us? 

When you get to select the combination flavors you want, watch freshly baked round white cakes exit the oven and begin their short journey on the conveyor belt where multiple workers customize them as requested and then box them in attractive cardboard, you are experiencing tantalizing delayed gratification until you get to your car and can break open the box and take that orgiastic first bite. 

YEUWEEE! Instant sugar rush accented with both loud and subtle flavors. 

Strawberry Lemonade, Blueberry Bake, French Toast, Bananas Foster...you get the picture. They taste even better than your imagination. And the underlying donut cake is a strong platform; mildly vanilla light white that taste good in their own right. 

Certainly not inexpensive compared to other shops, but a perfect indulgence when you want to treat yourself well.

rsbAquHp7zseJxNRs_pBFw,dYYkzkiAQoOtRjdR0kcspw,5,54,"If I lived in Nashville, I'd be here weekly. The food, drinks, service, & ambiance make this 2015 distillery a 5-star establishment. And if it's a tour of the distillery you want, reserve your spot today! 

Open 11 AM - 10 PM Monday thru Saturday, & 11 AM till 8 PM on Sundays, live music is scheduled every Friday evening then again on Sundays mid-day. 

You can enjoy a $13 Sampler Flight; it includes 5 tasters of any draft beer. Currently, there are 17 beers on tap. There's also an online store for Brew Works merchandise (w/ merchandise also sold on site, including gift cards). Every Sunday, $1 from every pint sold is donated to a local charity or nonprofit. (The December recipient is The Nashville Food Project.)

Executive Chef Alex Liebow is responsible for the ""craft beer-inspired food menu."" Private events are held at the distillery.

The 6-beer ""Beer Burger"" was exceptional! And  the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich was also delicious, although you may want to ask for more heat if you are keen on spice. Unlike some chefs @ other eateries, our chef today was kind enough to split our entrees for us before they were brought to our table-- we appreciated it. The $12 Mint Julep was good, but costly. Our best edible, though, was the side salad-- Cesar Salad made w/ Baby Kale. Truly a PHENOMENAL tasting salad! 

Pete E was a very friendly server, & twice management took the time to stop by our table to converse. Loved the customer attention! 

This distillery offers a small first floor corner stage for live music, oak-barrel tables, two floors of dining, a front raised open patio w/ infrared heaters, a second floor open patio (roped off today), a bar on the second floor w/ an overview of the actual distillery, & a closeup of the distillery as patrons make their way to the back restrooms (where only one diner may enter & exit @ a time-- see pic). 

This aestetically pleasing establishment, w/ its excellent beers & delicious handhelds, is a great place to unwind. And the second floor dining area would be a perfect place for a birthday celebration or other type of gathering-- see pic. 

You'll find no paper menus here & even the receipts are to be scanned. Curbside pickup & no contact delivery are offered services. 

Quite impressed w/ this distillery & eatery. Located in the downtown Nashville area, this would easily become my hangout if I resided in the area.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1ef54dc13e8c0e3092""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Breweries, Venues & Event Spaces, Beer Bar, Food, Pubs, Tours, Nightlife, Restaurants, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Bars, Beer Tours, Arts & Entertainment, American (Traditional), Gastropubs, Music Venues, American (New)"",""business_id"":""dYYkzkiAQoOtRjdR0kcspw"",""name"":""Tennessee Brew Works""}]"

In case you didn't know, this is the original location which is located on Hollister Ave in the Goleta section of Santa Barbara, California. Unlike any other Habit locations that I've ever been to, this one is all outdoor seating. 

For lunch today, my fun time in Santa Barbara is never completed without the Santa Barbara Char which is known for. It's quite popular in SB. That's what I ordered, and always be my kind of burger. Oh, I got some fries too, just for the heck of it. It's so good, and for an good price, and way better than Five Guys... and those other Five Guys (Burger King, McDonald's, Carl's Jr, Jack in the Box, and Wendy's). Can't beat The Habit!

For parking, there's parking in the back, but it's kinda iffy though. And there's also street side parking. 

Service here was great.

2L3vbvUqBpPnMNd8y20GdA,g5ogvPhw3PSobtaZFkdEXg,5,79,"Walking down the street to this place was spectacular, you get to enjoy the view of New Orleans at its finest, on Magazine. With that being said, if you're lucky you'll be able to snag some free parking, but besides that, a majority of the parking is pay to park. 

But anyways, the sign's small, but noticeable enough to anyone who actually pays a bit of attention! Once I walked in, I was greeted by the cashier and offered a vanilla latte that was accidentally made, because why not? While I was sipping on the latte, I started to peer into the decadent case with numerous cupcakes available for your choosing. 

I always ask one simple question with regards to the menu in any place I visit:

""What would YOU recommend?"" 

It's a question I love, and the cashier at Bittersweet Confections immediately recommended the wedding cake cupcake. So, I got one of those, and another of the chocolate cupcake with vanilla bean icing. So let's get down to the taste test!

Wedding Cupcake:
(Visual 5/5, Flavor 4.5/5)
Edible glitter I guess it was? The entire top of the cupcake sparkled with a gorgeous appearance that proves hard to resist. The piping was similar to that of a rose on top of the base layer accompanied by silver sparkling sprinkles. The golden base retained its moisture regardless of the fact that I decided to bring home the cupcake to share with my parents. Keep in mind they live about an hour and a half away. 

The icing was delicious, and the almond flavor coupled with almond buttercream definitely enhanced the experience!

Chocolate Cupcake with Vanilla Bean Icing:
(Visual 5/5, Flavor 5/5)
If anything, my parents actually loved this flavor the most! The top of the icing was layered with what seemed to be golden edible glitter! The chocolate base was delicate, and the vanilla bean in the icing was much more evident than the almond in the wedding cake! 

One of the things that I can appreciate about a business is care, especially care with regards to their product. The consistency of both cupcakes I had were amazing, and you could tell just by looking through the clear case encasing the cupcakes that the employees also acknowledge persistency. 

If you're ever walking through New Orleans, be sure to stop by, they also offer free Wi-Fi with plenty of tables inside! :)","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1ef54dc13e8c0e340f""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Cupcakes, Caterers, Food, Chocolatiers & Shops, Bakeries, Specialty Food, Breakfast & Brunch, Shopping, Desserts, Restaurants, Event Planning & Services"",""business_id"":""g5ogvPhw3PSobtaZFkdEXg"",""name"":""Bittersweet Confections""}]"

R2TBGyyDaCq0LwWsjiElYA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,5,142,"The best food-related thing that happened to me in 2019 was that when I tried to book dinner at Philadelphia's award-winning Zahav Restaurant, the place was unable to accommodate my request.

My dining companion, a local Philadelphian, suggested that we try Suraya, a Lebanese restaurant well-regarded by Philly's food press. Though I was skeptical of Suraya's newness and trendy popularity, I am a sucker for good Lebanese cooking, so I booked a reservation.

As a result, I enjoyed the best meal I've eaten in years. Thanks, Zahav.

[n.b. I'm about to sound ensorceled by Suraya's charms, so to maintain some credibility, here's my single complaint: Suraya's cardamom-scented kouign-amann was good, but not as good as one I had earlier that day at ICI Macarons & Cafe. That's it. That's all I've got.]

**********
Our meal began at Suraya's tidy bar, where, on the recommendation of our barman, Jesse, we ordered Old-Fashioneds made with Sazerac Rye. Mine was the smoothest and most elegant Old-Fashioned I've ever tasted. Jesse is a boss.

My buddy and I had arrived with a plan in mind. The flexibility of Suraya's tasting menu and the range of choices it offered appealed to us, and we'd already made our selections.

But then we were shown to our table, a perch set slightly above the main floor that provided a view of the open kitchen, where a wood-burning oven was cooking the dinner I didn't know I wanted.

As she took our order, our server, Nena, asked if I'd like the special: slow-roasted young goat with stewed chick peas, Swiss chard, garlic and cilantro, finished with crispy shallots, lemon yogurt and goat jus.

Are you kidding me?

Does a stranded man long for his lover's embrace? Do birds enjoy a light thermal lift as they cross the sea? And, speaking of birds, do Eagles fans revel as Tom Brady slips into aged decrepitude?

The answers, of course, are ""yes,"" ""yes,""  and ""Hell, yes!"" 

I thanked Nena and asked, ""May I please have the goat as a part of the tasting menu?"" She said, ""Sure,"" then left for the kitchen.

Soon, Nena brought our mezza, then these things happened:

- Substantial but light and slightly lemony hummus that reminded me of the hummus my Teta made by hand, fifty years ago

- Baba ganoush, whose charred eggplant was seasoned with tehina, lemon, garlic and a special treat: sweet and smokey urfa biber chili

- Muhammara, a smooth spread of roasted red pepper and pulverized walnuts blended with chili and cumin 'til it was dense and rich, like pesto, but spicier and more appetizing 

- Labneh, an Arab dairy respite from smoke and spice, a purpose served in other cuisines by lassi, tzatziki and kefir
 
- Tabouli, a usual hearty and cooling salad of parsley, cucumber, tomato, scallion and mint, made unusual by a tart drop of pomegranate molasses

Nena, a skilled and personable server, was unstoppable, as was the mezza, which also included: fried kibbeh (beef and bulgur ""dumplings"" stuffed with raisins & pine nuts); fattoush (another salad, dressed with lemon-pomegranate vinaigrette); and baskets of fresh-baked Arab bread or ""khubz"" that was just-chewy, tender and good enough to eat on its own, all night long.

**********
Here's how to eat at Suraya: bite, savor, look around, order more, take a different bite, chat, sip, then do it all again.

Dining at a Lebanese table is a creative endeavor that requires one to engage; ""What should I taste next? How would this taste if combined with that?"" We're also asked to appreciate the art on the plate; not gratuitous ""look-what-I-can-do"" decoration, but actual food, placed in such a way that the eater is enticed not to gush and take photos, but to eat.

By now, seven stellar dishes into the evening, I'd abandoned my usual pessimistic expectations. I was persuaded to trust Suraya's chef and his cooks to respectfully interpret recipes handed down by the owners' grandmother - the eponymous Suraya - and developed in consultation with her daughter, Maude.

It was clear that they weren't trying to improve (or, despicably, to ""reimagine"") Suraya's food in some Millennial way, but were instead doing as they'd been taught, then ever-so-slightly tweaking, using best-quality and authentic ingredients that took their food from what one might find at home to dishes one might find in the best hotels along Beirut's Corniche.

**********
For his main course, or ""mashawi"" - a rough equivalent to the Italian ""secondo"" - my friend ordered kawarma - Suraya's grilled and slow-roasted lamb, which was rubbed with ""baharat,"" a mixture of black pepper, allspice, cardamom and other savory spices.

I tasted his meal, which was delectable. Then I savored my own fork-tender, succulent, almost buttery portion of goat ribs and loin. I'm embarrassed to say that I gloated as I announced that my plate won the evening.

Finally, as a bonus, Suraya only offers roasted goat every few weeks - ten orders per night - and by coming across it when I did, I lucked out. 

So really; thanks again, Zahav.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1ef54dc13e8c0e3417""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Active Life, Beer Gardens, Grocery, Middle Eastern, Specialty Food, American (New), Parks, Cafes, Food, Nightlife, Restaurants, Coffee & Tea, Lebanese"",""business_id"":""vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g"",""name"":""Suraya""}]"

NOT a poke fan, but was strangely craving it on my drive home. Here you get to choose 1-3 proteins. And on Tuesdays, you'll get an extra topping at no charge. My triple Ahi Bowl w/ Spring Mix, imitation crab, extra cucumber, carrots, some type of green bean, light corn, garlic sauce (& probably other fresh ingredients I've forgotten) is DELICIOUSLY fresh! It is REALLY good. See pic...

Lots of inside tables within this Hawaiian-themed eatery, as well as two outside tables in front. Endless parking. 

I enjoyed my free sample of Dole Whip (I sampled a Pineapple/Vanilla swirl). It's vegan friendly, gluten & dairy free, & something else I can't recall because I was too busy sampling:) 

Service was phenomenal! And my Ahi poke bowl actually begs me to return. Prices could have been lower, but they seemed quite standard for poke establishments. (The $1 extra for the guacamole was well worth the upcharge-- great guac!)

If you've been to the De La Vina location these are the same owners serving up their ever so popular Al Pastor tacos. But the price has increased to $1.99 as opposed to the $1.75, but that's ok! Still worth it to me. The tortillas are handmade so that makes them extra special.

The location is not the best with a small parking lot of 10 spaces available, but there is street parking on Nogal.  

Occupany is for about 28 people. 

The menu at this location will be expanding and soon they will be open for breakfast serving up burritos, coffee, and milkshakes. Say whaat? Milkshakes for breakfast? Yes that's right. Flavors will be strawberry, banana, papaya, and mango. Tortas coming soon as well.

Today was the second day they have been open 2.23.16, so they're still trying to ease on in at this new location. 

If you have any suggestions or recommendations don't be afraid to speak up to the staff! Noe who is one of the family staff members says they love to hear feedback on any improvements. Pleasing the customer is their top priority. 

Today I had 2 Al Pastor tacos, and one carne asada. I wish I had ordered 4 because the meat was perfectly cooked! Juicy and delicious. 

Spread the word and come support this family owned business. Thank you Noe & Laura for your great customer service! Looking forward to many more trips here.

geBSZTzgGJ3V8YAb_mtBqQ,3StNEgKAwpCFR1q0urmJrw,5,86,"We came to Raijin on a Sunday night for dinner to celebrate a good friend's promotion.  Parking was limited and most patrons had to find parallel spots on the street.  

Our party had to wait outside in line but were called in within 15 minutes to wait on the inside benches.  We were seated shortly after that in a comfortable booth that accommodated 4 easily, but anymore would have been a stretch.

We were started with waters and deliciously fruity chu hi drinks (Japanese soju highballs with surprisingly high alcoholic content).  After browsing other Yelp reviews, I knew I wanted to try many of their appetizers so I ordered takoyaki, karaage, fried octopus, and gyoza to share.  Everything came out very quickly and piping hot.  The fried dishes were perfectly crunchy and golden.  The gyozas was bathed in dumpling sauce but was somehow still crispy.

Entrees also arrived quickly and were very hot.  I ordered the black garlic tonkotsu.  Presentation was gorgeous and the serving was generous.  It came with bamboo, half of a soft boiled egg, and a thick slice of pork, all topped with black edamame seeds.  The garlic in the broth was not overpowering and all flavors were excellent complements.

I would dare say the food was Los Angeles-caliber good.  Service was fast and friendly.  The price was very reasonable.  Four appetizers and four ramen entrees came out to about $110.

Me and my friend decided to try the 3 for $10 deal on the menu. Our choices were Western Style, SB Style and Pizza Dog. 

My first bite of the Western Dog was amazing! From the BBQ sauce, the slight kick from the jalapeño to the snap in the hot dog. Well there was definitely a party going on in my mouth. 

The SB Style had bacon, avocado, cilantro, crema aka Mexican sour cream, and a bunch of other yummy stuff!

CQWC7PVzGPI6-B8Pbll3iA,B6Lvq3sOYwhKxPzadDka9g,5,91,"Ka-POW! No I don't work for Zeppoli, however I am offering you my opinion of a wonderful restaurant. Yes, its small and yes it gets a bit cramped, maybe also a bit noisy, but the food overwhelms all the preceding challenges.

We were celebrating and a small group of us decided to try something adventurous. We already had experienced the talents of Chef Baldino and tonight after getting into town I let this talented Chef  create and serve to us whatever he wanted. 

It was a memorable and delicious evening. So many plates that I am sure I will leave some out, however I want to emphasize, everything was top notch.

We started with a rich Homemade Ravioli stuffed with what tasted like the Chef's Gnocchi, served in a Brown Butter Sauce. Melt in our mouths goodness. 

Then we were served Cockle Clams with Sausage in an incredible broth. On another plate fresh prepared Artichoke Hearts under very well seasoned Bread Crumbs. Ka-Pow goodness.

Next Courses were three delectable Pasta Dishes. One with Oil, Garlic and Broccoli Rabe. A fantastic Plate of Pasta with a Rabbit Ragu. Wow, And the third plate of Pasta was the I believe was the Troffiette. Each of these dishes were wonderful.

Next Course was  a Fish, served whole almost like a Branzino. Our Server, Tommy did a wonderful job cleaning the fall off the bone tender fish. There was not a bone found. 

Meat Course was the Marinated rib-eye steak served with arugula and tomato salad. Magnificently Cooked and Fork Tender. Just the perfect amount of Garlic seasoning. The arugula and Tomato salad was tremendous. Some at the table mentioned how the Chef and its Kitchen's wonderful staff finds an out of season Tomato which tasted amazing. The Steak tasted as good if not better than any Steak House I have visited.

We were loosening our belts at this point.

Dessert was as good as good gets.

A Flourless Chocolate Cake, A Vanilla Homemade Gelato, and 3 out of this world after dinner aperitifs. One a Pistachio Flavored, One a Star Anise flavored, and the last a non flavored Cello. Simply delicious. 

Each and every one who joined me enjoyed the evening immensely, the service was terrific, and the center of everyone's attention was some of the finest Italian Food I have ever had the pleasure of eating. 

The cost was an absolute bargain. Less than 100 per person including Gratuity.

Id_vlXAVyXa0QuiqMfTZNg,8uF-bhJFgT4Tn6DTb27viA,5,151,"When walking down the French Quarter, this was about 1.9 miles, and we actually considered walking. Now before you consider wal - wait, don't. 

Your best bet to get to this heavenly, and yes, I mean HEAVENLY place (these donuts have officially provided me with an out of body experience) would be to drive your car and park on the sidewalk. Now with that being said, there's plenty of seats inside and outside of the place! Upon approaching the register, the woman working the counter gave us recommendations as I was looking into the gates of heaven. About eight donuts that are laid out inside of a small counter, with the workers constantly firing out more. 

Exciting to say the least, I could feel the donuts calling me, ""Jimmy, we're HERE! What you've been waiting so long for!"" They were right, this place was always on the corner of my mind while walking through New Orleans. My first time coming here, I absolutely had to get four of them. Now enough of me talking, let's get into the donuts themselves:

Banana Cream Donut (5/5):

I thought that the donut itself would be dry with regards to the numerous other donuts I've eaten. Boy was I wrong! After the first bite, I could taste the glaze along with a hint of banana cream. Who knew there was a filling? I was expecting just a plain white cream filling, however, that wasn't the case! The guys hear at District Donuts put time into their donuts, and you can taste it! The added touch of the two banana pieces on top which actually were caramelized, made this treat twenty times better. Definitely the best one of the four so far! 

Boston Cream Pie (4.5/5):

Identical was how I would describe this one. Perfect yet identical. This donut wasn't a disappointment in any aspect. If you've ever had a real Boston cream pie, this would be an exact replica. The cream inside is delicious but fluffy. Delicate, and not overpoweringly sweet. The chocolate glaze on top was moist and appealing on the pallet, almost like New Year's Eve fireworks (except you know, in your mouth).

Now, the other two donuts I chose were toasted coconut and lemon raspberry. Both of those for my parents, because sharing is caring! Overall, just being able to see the staff at District Donuts working hard with regards to making their fresh donuts combined with the delicious quality of the donuts were enough for me to say that I will be back, but hungrier, for more donuts!

uQVHDM0qjK0v3S__Hnxacw,M0Cb0ufPxOSHSrZAKMmUmg,5,56,"4.5 stars. I debated long & hard about this rating. For eateries, it's 4 stars, but as country diners go, it's five. It offers traditional foods @ decent prices, a daily specials board, good-sized servings, a mom & pop decor, as well as friendly service. Lots of homemade desserts made here, too-- 10 dessert offerings today! 

This is not a large eatery, but outside seating is available. 

Traditional egg breakfasts include deliciously sweet Italian sausage (see pic), sausage patty, sausage links, turkey sausage, steak, ham steak, bacon, corn beef hash, Canadia bacon, country fried steak, & a 6-oz sirloin. 

Also available for breakfast are 9 Omelets (including a Meat Lovers), 2 Skillet Meals, & Scrambles. Offered are 4 Pancake varities, French Toast, Stuffed French Toast, Belgium Waffles, Biscuits & Gravy, & Eggs Benedict (including the Crab Cake & Florentine varieties).

For LUNCH, you'll choose from Open Face Hot Sandwiches, Triple Decker Clubs, 7 Deli sandwiches, 3 Speciality Sandwiches, 5 Burgers (including a Veggie Burger), & 6 Hot Lunch Meals. Or you can try the Soups, Salads, miscellaneous other sandwiches, Melts, & a Fish Sandwich & Chicken Sandwich. 

There's a dinner menu as well-- see Yelp's menu pics. 

My two-egg breakfast @ $8.99 plus a pancake ($1.99) was very good. My companion's Hawaiian Melt (ham, cheese, & pineapple) w/ a side of fruit @ $7.99 was also very good, although the ham ratio was too high. 

Service was down home neighborly. The decor in this small, narrow dining room is charmingly tacky, & expected w/ an ol' time country diner. I won't hesitate to stop in whenever I'm in the area. I believe I hear the Pumpkin Waffles calling:)

Open 7 days weekly, but just till 3 PM on Saturday & Sunday.

phTrDDsCj2wCV-Vkac3Vzg,8uF-bhJFgT4Tn6DTb27viA,5,120,"These D-O-N-U-T-S...OMG... All I can say is good thing I don't live by this place or I'd be in big trouble! This place was voted one of the TOP 10 donuts shops in America and I definitely know why! 

Recently I made a trip to New Orleans for Mardi Gras and District Donuts was on my radar all the way from Los Angeles! Um yeah... I can sniff out good donuts from hundreds of miles away! 

 When I first walked in there was a line, but that didn't deter me. I was only worried they might run out of donuts and I was anxious to get my order in. The line looked pretty long but it only took me about 10 minutes to get through it. I was a overwhelmed because I wanted to try...um..all of them but I can only eat so much. When I finally got to the front of the line I found out my biggest nightmare had came true, they were sold out of the King cake donut, and that was the one I was really looking forward to trying! I asked them if I could pre-order it and wait to the side because they were cooking them, but they said they couldn't do that. I understood because there were so many people that wanted them that people pre-ordering could get confusing. 

If you're not familiar what king cake is, it is a cake during Mardi Gras in New Orleans that is covered with different colors like pink, purple, and yellow. Inside they hide a baby. The tradition is, whoever finds the baby in the king cake has to buy the next king cake. These cakes are very popular during Mardi Gras. 

I ended up buying a box of donut. It included the Wedding cake donut, the NOLA, Red velvet, and the Spicy Maple Praline donuts. I also got a buttermilk drop (it's like a buttermilk biscuit that taste like a donut), a buttermilk biscuit and chocolate chip cookies. Don't judge, I shared all my goodies with a group of friends, that way I could taste everything. For full enjoyment I advise you buy all the above or you will be cheating yourself! 

While I was sitting in the store eating my donuts the owner came up and asked me if I wanted a king cake donut. He had heard the commotion I made at the counter about wanting a King Cake donut and my disappointment. I thought that was really awesome, and I didn't have to wait in line. Thank you Aaron! 

Unfortunately I was so focused on their donuts I missed out on getting some of their breakfast sandwiches and the Croquenuts (griddled donut sandwiches). They look so good that I could kick myself for not trying at least 3 of them each! 

Most importantly donut lovers, District Donuts  changes their donuts daily, which is a good and a bad thing. The good thing is there is a bunch of different kind of donuts that seem endless. The bad news is I don't live in New Orleans so I won't be able to try them all. If you live out here take advantage of how lucky you are. Here's a list of just a few of the donuts they have....

ok5zSpq9yH8o1PFK3GA7vQ,koeubKPpi6ax4FDh7_zcWg,5,51,"Palo de Azucar Cafe (Sugar Stick Cafe) is the second coffee house at this location that was an old time Italian deli for over fifty years before changing hands. I was a customer of that antique urban store, and loved their breakfast sandwiches, especially the sausage, egg and cheese creation. The old grill in the back room turned out many a delicious meal. 

So, when I saw that the new place had a morning menu including a SEC sammy, I know the temptation to explore that offering would be too great to let me stay away for long. 

And, so it was. I walked in today after finding a parking spot open in front. The room looked the same as the first cafe, but with interesting artwork on the walls, and a very pleasant crew of baristas handling the preparations on the polished stainless Expresso maker. I asked for the sandwich and large coffee, and looked around while waiting for it to be completed. Clean and well maintained. 

I watched as one of the women made my bagel sandwich on the small grills on the back shelf. Double meat. Double soft fried egg. Double cheese. She and I had a brief conversation about how Trenton had changed over the years (not all for the better, we agreed), but certainly with new life springing up in the shadows of this former ""All American City."" She constructed the layers of ingredients and nicely packaged it for my trip down the street to the office. That sticky decal with the cafe's logo was a very nice touch. 

Saving the best for last, the sandwich was among the best desayunos I've had the pleasure to consume. It was loaded, and each bite an explosion of tastes and textures, as my teeth slices through it. Amazing how exponentially better doubling the contents made the dish. A bagel is leaky by design, but it wasn't so extrusive as to require extreme caution. Yes, my fingers were involved in picking up all that fell out. It was all too good to waste. The coffee was a medium roast that continues to hold its flavor without bitterness to this very moment. 

At five minutes from the office, Palo de Azucar is too good to not become a regular morning stop. The sandwich so reminded me of the old guy cooking in the backroom, that it was almost like he was still around. 

Great way to commemorate the great grandfather of the shop by allowing his spirit to shine through.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0df576""},""stars"":""5"",""categories"":""Cafes, Restaurants, Food, Coffee & Tea"",""business_id"":""koeubKPpi6ax4FDh7_zcWg"",""name"":""Palo De Azucar Cafe""}]"

When you supposedly had the best Hainanese chicken in the world in Singapore (Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken) from the likes of Anthony Bourdain and Mike Chen and this place tops that, that is saying a lot! And I didn't have to sweat my tush like I did the other place which was at a hawker. This is Hainanese Chicken THAI style.

We wanted to try both of their boiled and fried chicken so we ordered the Set 3: Boneless Chicken with 3 Sets of Soup & Ginger Chicken Rice. One of the things I love about chicken flavored rice is the fresh grated ginger. The clear radish soup had a nice kick to it. The meal is accompanied by three different dipping sauces. But the chicken is the star...super juicy and perfectly cooked. We all favored the fried chicken, the crispiness of the skin was tasty and not oily. At the end of the plate were some gizzards and liver. Aside from their famous chicken dishes, there are many noodle, fried rice and curry dishes.

This place is tiny with only a few tables. Best to come here as soon as it opens or do takeout so you don't have to wait.

RKyNdQaczRYK8xjYJdXdlQ,gCuC7255XLP-KGuFqYFaSw,5,71,"Lou Malnati's  is a genuine Chicago deep dish and pizza giant hailing from Chicago that has opened some locations in Indianapolis. This particular location in the vibrant broad ripple neighborhood of the city. 

Me and my family are on a weekend at getaway to Indy from louisville as my daughter has a cheer comp. My niece team is also in town cheering so we all got together for dinner on night one. Me being a huge fan of the original Lou Malnati's in Chicago I was stoked to see one come closer to our home city. So where to dine night one was a no brainer. 

We walked into This circus themed establishment filled with fun signs and Art and playhouse mirrors on a Friday night. Place was mildly crowded but they had a booth in the back that could fit are large party so we sat down immediately. 

Now I'll preface This review with the opinion that Lou Malnati's is the best pizza I've ever had. I held this opinion coming in. So I was expecting a 5 star dining experience. Which we did receive. There deep dish chicago style pizzas are as delish in Indiana as they are in Illinois. I'm sure they would be great in Kentucky too (hint hint for any Lou Malnati's decision makers who may want to invest in a Lousiville location). 

We started off with two apps as the kids were hungry and genuine Chicago deep dish takes some time to prepare. We aren't Chicago deep dish Rookies so we know the deal on waiting. We got an order of calamari and an order of cheese sticks.  The calamari was solid. Very chewy compared to others and the sauce they use had a different type of spice to it that I'm not quite sure worked for any of us. We all ended up dipping in the mozzarella sticks sauce. The mozzarella sticks were great. Very good flavor and nice and cheesy. 

For our entree we got a large and medium Chicago deep dish cheese, my father got a 3 meet deep dish personal pan, my wife got a massive salad, a picky nephew got a thin crust cheese pizza and my mom got a stuffed spinach bread. So we did some sampling. All the pizzas were great (we knew they would be). My wife said her salad was fantastic and my mom loved her spinach bread and was shocked at how filling it was. 

Overall great experience. Good service, fun vibe and family atmosphere and of course that classic Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza. I'm seriously envious of our Indiana neighbors 2 hours down the road. It would be great to have a Lou Malnati's in our hometown of Lousiville!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0df592""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Pizza, Restaurants, Italian"",""business_id"":""gCuC7255XLP-KGuFqYFaSw"",""name"":""Lou Malnati's Pizzeria  - Now Open!""}]"

While small in size with only a few hightops and an loveseat, it is warm and welcoming due to the hard work of the owner, Barbara, who wears her heart on her sleeve and makes everyone feel like family. 

I was looking for a good cuppa joe and a light early repast when this place jumped onto my Yelp screen. I parked across the street at a meter ($.25/hour), and crossed Main Street (York Road) to get to the door. I was the only customer when I arrived and had a few moments to chat with the proprietress as she expressod my Cafe Americano and walked back into the kitchen to put together my breakfast sammy on an everything bagel. Let me just say that I felt much compassion and sympathy for her as she spoke about her current circumstances. Stop by if you want to know more.

The coffee was excellent. Roasted by Valerio in Audobon, PA, it was rich, darkly volcanic soil based, and full of nutty and savory fruit tones. Probably should have purchased a bag of their Congo whole beans, but thought I might visit their roasterie and get it there I was so impressed. The sandwich (sausage, egg & Swiss) was also very good, but not as memorable as the java. They did harmonize well together, though. 

I do hope all goes well for the family, and that Mad Hatter stays a magical place for superior coffee and a comfortable time out.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e265c""},""stars"":""5"",""categories"":""Coffee & Tea, Sandwiches, Cafes, Soup, Food, Restaurants"",""business_id"":""idVfZKAHYec4C3VevKgkag"",""name"":""Mad Hatter Cafe""}]"

I arrived during a closed event; the business was open for just VIPs. The very friendly manager gave me permission to take photos,  & twice thanked me for doing so.

One of the most iconic things about Mike's is definitely the location, in beautiful downtown Nashville. With country music blaring and tourists walking around, it kind of almost feels like home! Once I walked into Mike's the place was packed, and the weather, chilly as ever! Seeing as I was only spending a few days here, I had to go big, triple scoop for $5.50!

Here's the flavors I got:

Red Velvet Cake (4/5):

Chunks of red velvet cake, and the color of the ice cream was a dark red! Something out of a Dr. Seuss book almost! What I loved most about it was the fact that the pieces of cake inside the ice cream were delicate and not dry. Actually pretty moist in combination with the ice cream!

Tennessee Fudge (4.5/5):

Come on now, we're in Nashville, I can't NOT get Tennessee Fudge! Almost like cookies and cream, but the pieces of cookie were bigger and tastier! It was rather delicate on the pallet, and definitely fulfilled my needs as a person with a sweet tooth!

Caramel Cone (4.2/5)

Little chunks of caramel lodged into the ice cream along with a good amount of caramels drizzle, this one was definitely flattering! 

Overall, sitting at Mike's and staring out of the window, it kind of reminded me of a scene in movie.

Hours are Monday - Friday from 11am-3pm

I've been to Dave's at the Milpas location but it's hard for me to get down there, so I was thrilled when I heard about this new location specifically open for lunch! 

Dave has a lunch special for $10! This will get you a choice of any two dogs on the menu, chips, and a beverage. Great deal especially for these specialty dogs made with lots of love. 

What did I order? 

The Mac n cheese dog (secret special of the day)
Western Dog

The Mac n cheese was very creamy, the bacon gave it a nice flavor. This is not something I would eat frequently because it's pretty rich, but I'm glad I could finally see what it was all about.

The Western Dog served with bacon, jalapeño slices, onion, and a bbq siracha mayo was my favorite. The jalapeños give it that spicy kick along with the Siracha mayo but it's not too spicy where it's burning up your mouth unless you happen to eat one of the jalapeno seeds then you're done. So eat with caution!

Dave was very welcoming and even though I visited his spot on Milpas St. he was still kind enough to give us the rundown on the menu. Thank you Dave!!

KZb-3LEjHkhVDyQoh2KRmw,oY-w5FbUv8YPA-vJmkdW1Q,5,54,"It is really nice to have expectations exceeded by a local slow/fast food shop. That was exactly what happened yesterday when we visited Curly's Comfort Food in Levittown, PA. 

Why ""slow/fast""? Because although Curly does cheesesteaks, burgers, chicken and all the accessories, which are typically considered fast food; it is so slammed with people ordering and waiting for their food that the first thing the ordertaker said to me was that there was a one hour wait for pickup. After ordering their Diablo Cheesesteak with fried onions, Firecracker Crisp Chicken Sandwich and standard Burger, she asked for my phone number to be able to alert me when the kitchen had prepared everything. Well, okay. We walked across the parking field to the H Mart for a little casual shopping in that well stocked Asian market. 

All the reviews suggesting the Curly's cheesesteak is the best of breed in the region. That is no lie! My son opened a zoftig sesame seeded long torpedo roll with enough thin sliced beef, cheese, jalapenos, and onions to fill at least two regular sized 'steaks.' He cut off a two inch end of the massive creation for me to taste, and he still couldn't finish it. My small sampling left me wanting more. It was a perfect roll wrapped around a glorious mix of deliciously delivered ingredients, complete with raw onion and sliced tomato. 

Simply stunning! 

The Firecracker Chicken wasn't far behind. Breaded and deep fried, it was a large breast with strong spice content, mayo, lettuce and tomato. I felt sorry for the round Kaiser roll attempting to hold it all together. It really couldn't, so before I was half way through it, I grabbed a knife and fork to assist. It was also excellent, and an unspoken contender in the chicken sandwich wars being waged by the franchises. Watch out, Popeye's and Chik-Fil-A! 

The burger was the simplest on the menu, but still a half pounder surrounded by a copious load of pretty good fries, in the same Kaiser roll, with the requested medium finish. Who ever heard of a takeout joint paying enough attention at the grill to deliver the right doneness? Curly did! 

Sure, the bill for all this quantity and quality was in the mid $40s. As I paid with that 3% credit card surcharge, I hoped it would all be worthwhile. Truth is that it was worth every penny and perhaps more, although that surcharge is obnoxious, and they would be doing a civic service to eliminate that, as it discriminates against the majority of consumers who are part of our credit economy.

PRO TIP - You have to ask them to switch the Diablo Chicken Steak to a Beef version which was not on the paper menu. It costs a little more, but definitely the way to go.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0e05e7""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Comfort Food, Restaurants, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Burgers"",""business_id"":""oY-w5FbUv8YPA-vJmkdW1Q"",""name"":""Curly's Comfort Food""}]"

I often wondered who in the heck would grab a bite here, of all places. I then kept reading about this place in many different local magazines and most recently from a review on yelp, Misty. I decided today was the day I would whip the car in here and check it out. I soon found out I had been missing out all of these years.

As I walked up to the window the nicest man said "" Hello  beautiful lady "" with the warmest smile on his face. He had such a sweet calming demeanor about him. He immediately knew it was my first time. I quickly discovered I was talking to the man himself, Paul. He set me up with a Chicago dog and fries. I also discovered this wonderful man and his dogs have won more awards than you can shake a stick at. Quietly proud he is and with good reason.

Brought my hotdog home and demolished the entire thing. I'm not a big hotdog person but I'll tell you what, the next time I'm craving one I know where I am headed...... Chicago Paulies.

SOHXP59toOalZPJjRQr8Eg,A9rVxmIBtHZRvNhbBaGAWg,5,72,"Szechuan House remains one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the Mercer/Bucks region. While it doesn't have everything nailed down in terms of consistency of flavor and presentation, it makes a strong statement for traditional Szechuan cuisine. They recently reopened after a lengthy renovation, and although the vibe is the same, it does appear cleaner on the dining room floor and likely in the kitchen, too. 

While food from Chengdu and Chongqing is more common here these days than it was decades ago, it remains an acquired taste for most consumers with its heavy hot chili spice and oil content. It is nothing like the sweeter Cantonese offerings found in Chinese American joints across the continent. For me the shift to preferring the numbing black peppercorns and flaming small red chillies over General Tso and the rest, came from my prolonged exposure to the kitchen heat during eight years I spent working and exploring the Middle Kingdom, primarily in Szechuan and Yunnan provinces. For me, eating this style food brings me back to the adventurous days when I became acculturated to this cooking, and loved life there. 

I would never say this is the best representation of Szechuanese cuisine in the western world, but it is damn good and satisfying. Yes, part of its attraction for me is reminiscing about the past, and they do need to use more peppercorns to capture the numbing elements of what I like most, but unless I want to travel to China to satisfy my yearnings, Szechuan House is about as good as it gets for the gestalt I seek. 

PS. Yes, Philly has some very strong candidates - Han Dynasty, Chili Szechuan, Chengdu Famous, Four Rivers and Ermi, among the best - they are not appreciably superior to S.H., although I love them all.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c18f54dc13e8c0ddbe2""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Chinese, Szechuan"",""business_id"":""A9rVxmIBtHZRvNhbBaGAWg"",""name"":""Szechuan House""}]"

The attention to detail is amazing from the welcoming tiles in the parking garage to the pleasant smell of flowers when you get on the elevator.

It has a perfect low-key appeal and design that feels ""Santa Barbara"" without the artificiality of primarily using white stucco and orange tiled roofs to fit local vibe like some fancy hotels in the area. Very cool place to stay and we loved it. The rooms are eclectic but memorable and we enjoyed resting in some of the public areas like the fireplace and fountain. 

The rooms have a GIANT bathtub for you to soak in and my wife was all chill and calm until she saw the shampoos, soap, and lotion were from ""Diptique"" and she went crazy texting her friends while I wondered why it felt slimy and made my eyes burn.

Location is tops, its easily walkable to some of the heavy-hitting sites and eateries in the Presido area, the longest we had to drive to anywhere else was 10 minutes.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e298b""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Cafes, Restaurants, Hotels"",""business_id"":""1wvYBjX6radqmb_k0Fv_Ug"",""name"":""Palihouse Santa Barbara""}]"

Prices vary depending on your choice but here's a rundown for 2017:

VIP - $115
Early Entrance - $90
General Admission - $69
VIP Designated Driver - $57.50
Designated Driver - $35

If you're thinking of checking out this festival be sure to look out for it on Groupon! They offer a great discounted price but you must act fast since this event is pretty popular. 

Tickets are sold at the event but it will cost you more so plan ahead and get a ticket to save some extra money! 

The choices of wine vendors is endless and you're bound to find one you will love! There is no way you will be able to cover everything with at least over 100 choices or so it seemed. There are a few beer stands for you beer lovers as well. Water is provided so be sure to stay hydrated! 

The entrance was well organized and once you walk in you are greeted with a nice souvenir glass to take with you along with a plate for all the goodies they have to sample. The most popular stand and the very first one you should hit up is Gelsons. They provide a beautiful spread of cheese, crackers, pepper jelly, and fruits. 

The second popular stand was Joya Sangria. They offer a red, white, and Rosé Sangria. The winner here was the red! I tried the Rosé and it wasn't too bad. A little on the sweeter side for me but still refreshing with ice. The pours here are very generous! 

There are a ton of vendors who not only offer samples but you can also purchase them at a discounted price such as organic raw honey, olive oils, toffee, and much more. 

Overall this event is a must and what more could you ask for with the location being centered at our beautiful beach.

xSkAJMQKLy3a4MNPa-7prA,b1okJ5qEPCIHbIgQ1NGyXQ,5,56,"Ok South Philly, I see you! From the owners of local brunch favorite Cafe y Chocolate (located just across the street), is this sweet ""New Mexican"" spot offering up dishes with tons of Latin flair and South American inspired ingredients you may not be able to pronounce. Try them! Trust me! Don't let the surroundings fool you, this cash only place is super legit and I warmly welcome it to this slowly, but surely flourishing neighborhood. This section of the city has been dubbed ""Puebladelphia"" due to it's plethora of no frills, damn good Mexican joints. This one however is more high end and a true stand out! 

We stopped by for lunch with the littles, chose a seat by the window on a gorgeous sunny Saturday afternoon. We sat upon floral cushions and had the entire place to ourselves. We looked around at tiny details... Christmas light strands, cacti and cool light ceiling fixtures. (Look up!). I thought to myself ""this cute, cozy space which they light with candles when it's dark, would be great for date night"", and after tasting what they had to offer, finding out they are BYO with mixers for purchase, I know one is in our near future! 

We were presented immediately with complimentary pineapple drizzled with a sweet sauce and topped with a not so overly spicy chili/salt blend. This simple starter was delish and much appreciated. Perfect balance of tart and spice. Nice touch! 

We started with the 'Esquites' $8 (roasted corn, epazote, garlic, lime, mayonnaise and cheese). Think Mexican Street corn, but off the cob! Squeeze a little of that lime and dig in! Great for sharing and these tasty kernels are also found in the squash blossom quesadilla. 

Hubs ordered the 'Pescado Frito' app for $8 and said it was one of the best breaded fish he has tasted. Nice bites of perfectly fried white fish served with a tangy dipping sauce. 

I chose the 'Vegetales' $14 (huitlacoche, Peruvian potato, mushrooms, chamomile, jalapeño, zucchini blossom purée). It was absolutely packed with flavor and quite delicious!! Meaty mushrooms, perfectly roasted potatoes and big hunks of zucchini served over smeared goodness. I could've licked that plate clean! What may seem a simple veggie dish was taken another level with the fragrant spices and flavors! So good! 

For the kiddos, we asked if they could make them a plain cheese quesadilla for which they charged $10 and had no issue obliging us. We were able to chose between corn or flour tortilla. We chose corn and they enjoyed a lot! This and the roasted corn app are great options for the wee ones!

We sipped on Jarittos and Coca Cola in old school bottles. Love that! The Mexican camomile tea under the drink section caught my eye also. Definitely trying that next time! 

Everything was the created with upmost care and presented just the same. Service was top notch and we were properly and patiently explained a few items we unsure of. We even got to meet the owner Arturo during our visit. I told him what a fan we were of his spot across the street and he thanked us! Both the waiter and owner were very kind, warm and welcoming. 

I can assure that you are in for a special, super flavorful, unique Mexican meal here in this tiny, corner BYO deep in South Philly. We all left highly impressed!

 From shrimp and chorizo apps, fresh cactus and avocado salads, to soups and stews, more casual street fare, larger platters which include skirt and hanger steaks, lamb shoulder, pork, chicken, beef and salmon, and desserts including truffles and hibiscus agave ice cream, you are bound to find something new and extremely tasty to enjoy. There's a little something for every palette, including fellow veg-heads. This isn't your average Mexican joint for sure.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1bf54dc13e8c0e08a1""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""American (New), Restaurants, Tacos, Mexican, Latin American, Vegetarian, New Mexican Cuisine, Breakfast & Brunch"",""business_id"":""b1okJ5qEPCIHbIgQ1NGyXQ"",""name"":""La Mula Terca""}]"

They charge per Oz and the tap monitors how much you pour. Very cool concept, I love tapas so this is like tapas beer! 

Along with the beer, the food was also really good, could not find a single complaint. Started with the fried mozzarella and meatball lollipops. Had fresh basil on top and were really delicious. 

My husband had the double-double burger. He loved it. I had the shrimp scampi pizza and I loved it! Waitress was good.

Deep down in Philadelphia close to South Street
Way back up by the Docks among the Philadelpheans
There stood a little basket with a plastic fork
From a sandwich shop named John's Roast Pork
Nobody ever learned to make pork so well
But it's the best you'll ever taste, you can tell by the smell

Go go... go to John's, go, go...
Go to John's, go...
Go to John's go...
Go to John's, go, go, go...
Johnny's Roast Pork!

If they sell the place to the Radiohead singer, who tends to leave parties without saying goodbye, and stop texting people he's been frantically sexting with, then it'll be renamed ""Thom 'Ghost' Yorke.""

John's Roast Pork is not only the best sandwich in Philadelphia. It may be the best sandwich in the United States. 

It's also extraordinary and unique, much moreso than a cheesesteak. I've never had anything remotely like it outside Philly, and nowhere else in Philly makes it this well. The Cheesesteak got the fame, but the Roast Pork is the secret reason to travel to the City of Brotherly Love. And with Tommy DiNic's a respectable second-best, this is *the* place to get Roast Pork in Philly.

If it were a show on Comedy Central where Leguizamo, Lovitz and Travolta jokingly insult the late Robin Williams (RIP), then it'd be ""Johns Roast Mork.""

What to get: Roast Pork sandwich with extra spinach, extra sharp provolone, wet.
Make sure: That you eat it while it's hot and wet. If you're eating it later, don't even bother.
And make sure: To check their hours. They open & close early. They're gone by 3 daily.
And also: They go on vacation sometimes in summer. So it's better to call and check.

If it were owned by the Mafia, it'd be Don's Roast Pork.

This sandwich is so good because of:

(a) dripping wetness and baked in heat. Juicy to the final bite.
(b) extremely heavy on the garlic, with a divine blend of spices.
(c) the spinach is magnificent, and the extra sharp provolone is melty, strong, and perfect.
(d) the pork itself is tender, thinly sliced, delicious, marinaded and magnificent.

If they stopped giving out spoons and forks, and instead gave out a combo-hybrid, then you could say ""John's Boasts Sporks.""

But it's not all about the Roast Pork. I'm not a massive fan of Cheesesteaks, but honestly, I think the John's Cheesesteak tastes better than any of the more famous rivals. I'd never come here for just a cheesesteak with the Roast Pork on offer, but sometimes I'll get one of each to share with an out-of-towner, and the conclusion is usually the same: The Pork is the food of the Gods. The Cheesesteak is not as good, but is the best Cheesesteak they've tried.

If you get drunk on wine here, or lose your virginity here (or both), you can call it ""John's Popped Cork.""

Roast Pork is not the only sandwich which Philly does very well (aside from the obvious). Try Nick's Old Roast Beef on 20th St, also with X-sharp Provolone. It's one of the best Roast Beef sandwiches in the nation.

If they're having a party for actor Mickey, and you all raise your glasses to him, then it's named ""John's Toast Rourke.""

I was annoyed when watching the food shows on TV, who always hype up Tommy DiNic's (excellent, but second best), and Tony Luke's (not even on the same planet, dry and much less flavourful), and allow John's to play second-fiddle when it's by far the best. It's all hype. Come here and treat yourself to one of the best sandwiches you will ever try.

And if the owner tells you that your wrist pains are probably from all of the twisting and pulling you do at the gym, then it can be said that ""John's Diagnosed Torque.""

And if you and the owner get it on with a wild Icelandic singer in a 3-way (it's okay if it's in a three way, Gaga told me so), then perhaps it's ""John's Spit-roast Bjork.""

Now back to Marty McFly.

I used to have their sandwich in a gunny sack
Go eat beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the Philly girls would see me sitting in the shade
And come and share the sandwich that John's Roast Pork made
And after we made out*, every girl would say
That's the best damn sandwich in the USA**

Go go... go to John's, go, go...
Go to John's, go...
Go to John's go...
Go to John's, go, go, go...
Johnny's Roast Pork!



* since we both ate the Garlic-infused pork, the make out session wasn't gross for either of us. I'm a wily one, see.

** I know I've called a few sandwiches the best in the USA, but you need to just trust me and try every single one of them. K. Thx.

From the perfectly fried golden outer half moon shell to the favor-packed shredded beef, black beans, & plantains that grace the soft inside, there is no escaping falling in love w/ this Venezuelan culinary creation. Once you dip this delightful production into the delicious cilantro-laden yellowish sauce, the only thing you'll crave is a long, slow puff on a figurative cigarette:) Seriously, this national dish is ASOMBROSA! 

Check out the pics before heading on over to try this delectable sensation served w/ a free & GENEROUS side of VERY friendly service! The dining room is spacious & clean w/ its high ceilings & modern colorblock of bright orange & neon green. Order @ the counter then sit & wait for each dish to be prepared fresh. 

Some history: Owners Jesus & Carmen originate from Venezuela; in Nov 2014, they opened the doors to welcome hungry & soon happy patrons to this family-owned business. Chef Carmen, a former math & physics teacher, created the dishes which cross the cultural divide by fusing Venezuelan & Lebanese flavors. The results are EXCELLENT! 

What possibly is left to say about such a worthy eatery other than a couple of relatable Venezuelan sayings: When you are ""Hungrier than a tick on a stuffed toy,"" head on over to Are Pita. RUN-- don't walk, because ""Hungry love doesn't last."" The PABELLON EMPANADA on your plate will not be there long.

Today it was a snow day (weekday) lunch with the family. I have been numerous times for breakfast, coffee and croissants, eggs.. many lunches with friends, my fave is the French onion soup and salad lyonnaise. Although other lunches I've loved have been the croque madame and salad nisoise..and my son loves the mac and cheese. The bread basket is the best in town and we fight over the baguette slices. I also regularly buy baguettes from the front desk for $3, (at least every other week) great with dinner at home. The cheese boards are always yum, although no matter the restaurant they often have cheddar which I always request to switch out, because ... come on!!!!

Yup I'm starting with that.
Listen here...I've been trying to get a cheesesteak at this place for the past few months, but every time I'm in the area the line is around the corner. Finally I drive by this time and the line is reasonable! I dropped the wife and kid off at chick-fil-a and headed right back to get in line. 
I brought a bottle of water with me anticipating an hour between waiting, ordering, and waiting some more. I met a nice woman and her daughter in line who were also cheesesteak adventure seekers as well who made the wait feel a lot shorter (even tho it was still overall an hour.) 
Once I had that cheese steak in hand, I said goodbye to my cheese steak  line friends and headed to pick up the fam. Even tho the cheese steak had been sitting 30 min before I could eat it, that first bite solidified it being literally THE BEST CHEESE STEAK I'VE EVER HAD so far!
Why?? Because it wasn't small, nor overcooked, nor soggy, nor unseasoned. It was tasty even without ketchup! Of course I got mine with fried onions and mayo just an FYI. Even the roll had that strong good ole philly roll flavor. I was just sad it was ending as I came upon the last few bites. I don't even want to have another cheese steak anywhere else.

6NZTp-L2mTRgpTZ142eL9Q,DbARcEuX6NvWN_hSQKHMJg,5,181,"I'm not the type of yelper that updates reviews very often. This marks my 1,197th review of which only 105 are updates. Of those updates, there are only a handful of places I've bothered to review more that twice. This is now my third review of Wat!

I say that to emphasize the fact that this unassuming place with incredibly reasonable prices and no fancy dishware or super modern decor, no roof or walls in fact, is one of my favorite places to eat on earth. I've been coming here for six years consistently. As a matter of fact, I don't schedule a visit to Tampa that doesn't include a Sunday morning with 3 hours set aside to visit Wat Mongkolratanaram. I would consider it gross negligence and an injustice to my digestive system. Yes there is a lot of fried and/or high carb foods here! But if your gonna die (as we all will)... die happy!


The reason for this update is to inform all you potential patrons of a few changes:
A) Many of the vendors often begin serving food much earlier than the 9am start time.
B) The people that once used to make the fried custards are no longer in business.  
C) The curry station has moves to the opposite side of the venue in order to make more room for the beef noodle line (the longest line of any of the vendors). 
D) The food is still awesome and the vendors still very friendly and reasonably priced.


[ MUST TRY ITEMS ]

* THAI FRIED CHICKEN WINGS - To date there is only one vendor that serves fried chicken wings, so they shouldn't be hard to find. 

* MANGO & STICKY RICE -  The same vendor that serves the fried wings also serves the best sticky rice. Trust me when I say, buy a minimum of one container for every two people in your party. We love it so much that we buy one for each of us.

PUMPKIN CURRY CHICKEN - Just get it!!! If you love curry chicken you'll be delighted by the flavor. Please note the pumpkin adds a touch of sweetness.

THAI BEEF NOODLE SOUP - I still prefer PHO to any noodle soup, but this is a lovely treat on a Sunday morning. It was particularly nice on this visit considering it was a fairly cold November morning for Tampa.



[ FINAL THOUGHTS ]

So many great selections at great prices. I literally hand my kids $20 each and let them go find whatever they want to eat... and that is on top of my paying for each of us to have a bowl of Beef Noodle Soup. This is the one place in all our travels where every family member is always eager to return. It's not just great food and reasonable prices, it's an experience, one I hope someday everyone reading this review will get a chance to share. If you do nothing else in life specifically for you, find someplace that you can have a WONDERFUL meal and treat yourself as often as needed!

SIDE NOTE: Our other must visit Tampa food experience is Armature Works and market. A place where food lovers can gather in a super cool and comfy foodie utopia.

Each and every time I have received excellent:

-Customer service...
The two brothers who work here remember my partner's and my names, plus always smile while carrying on a friendly conversation.

-Food...
Their food is absolutely spectacular and is easily at the top of my list for Italian cuisine in Santa Barbara County. Deliciousness starts with the appetizers and continues through to dessert. Their seafood dishes are always fresh and pasta cooked perfectly al dente. Oh and their thin crust pizzas are not to be missed either!

-Ambiance...
Given the strip mall corner unit location, you wouldn't know the interior is as large as it is! They have minimal yet elegant decor, dim lighting, and a lovely outdoor patio with a fountain.

Most recently, my family took advantage of Ca' Dario's New Year's Eve pre-fixe meals for $85. It came with a small plate of choice, lasagna, main entree, and an included bottle of Dard wine.

It's time to see if these places are as good as I remember, if they've taken a nose dive or if they have risen from the pit of mediocrity into something worthy of updating.


THE EXPERIENCE

I'm happy to report Wat Mongkolratnaram is actually more deserving of 5 stars now than they were then. Since my 2013 visit I've been back here a few times (twice in 2015) and each has been a fantastic experience. During our Spring Break, we explored the side of the property where the monks live and got to see their offices, kitchen and worship areas. We were not allowed in the sleeping quarters, but everything else was open. We also spent that visit trying different foods from different vendors. Some we like, some we didn't.  During our Christmas Vacation, we concentrated instead on the foods we already know and love - Mango Sticky Rice, Beef Noodle Soup, Thai Fried Chicken Wings and Thai tea. Each seemed to be even more spectacular than the last time we ate here. 

It was a perfect Florida winter's day where the temperature, by Atlanta standards, was t-shirt weather! We arrived a little later than usual (around 10:45 am) and had to park further back that we've ever had to park before. Although very crowded, all the lines moved quickly with the exception of the beef noodle soup line and fried custard line. You can expect to stand in the soup line better than 25 minutes if you don't get there BEFORE the vendors open @ 10:30 am.


THINGS TO REMEMBER

* BRUNCH is SUNDAY ONLY
* GET HERE EARLY!!! It will help you avoid being way at the back of the lines, help you secure a better parking space and you won't have to search for an available table to sit down and eat your meal. 
* Many of the monks will not hold a conversation with you NOR will they take a picture with you, but they will direct you to a leader who'd be happy to do both. 
* Be respectful of the temple and other buildings occupied by the monks. THIS IS A PLACE OF WORSHIP and anyone coming here, no matter your religious beliefs, should honor their ways. SHOES OFF in the temple and no loud speaking or vulgar speech. 
* Sometimes when it is really cold outside or raining they have an area behind the vendors that is covered and has additional seating. The restrooms are also located there. 
* This is an outdoor facility with communal tables. Other than the covered areas provided, you WILL be subject to temperatures and the wind of the day, so dress accordingly.


FINAL THOUGHTS

If you've never been to Wat Mongkolratanaram of Florida, you are missing out on a real treat! Make plans to stuff your face in this place soon!

T2a-HOjI_zUXj_gxDZGS6w,VHWCzIZXpWPyeFe2lkIutQ,5,56,"I really enjoy adaptive reuse of old buildings that bring old and new sensibilities to the fore. When done well, they are both attractive and useful in ways unforeseen when the structure was first constructed, and bring new uses into old packages, calling the imagination of the new occupant forward in wonderment. The Johnson Hall Coffee House is a great example. It offers a shop unimagined in 1890 when it was build, yet as redesigned, it provides a functioning java house that could have existed at that time, but has emerged due to the evolving cultural affections of our modern day. It looks old, but isn't. 

It is a  warm, light and airy high ceilinged first floor retail outlet for excellent coffee products and breakfast, brunch and lunch options. Although limited by the kitchen equipment available to prepare meals, it still provides enough variety to make a stop very worthwhile. I loved the large windows, dropped period lighting, white ceramic tile, wood plank floors, and the friendliness of the staff. 

I ordered an egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on croissant, with mug o' joe. It came in at about $8, and while ordering was at the counter in back, the servers brought the sandwich to my table. They would be wise to advertise the coffee roaster more dominantly both in the store and online, as I am sure I was not the only one curious about who produced the quality beans. The croissant was not quite French boulangerie, but still large and tasty enough to be satisfying. 

Still, the atmosphere here is the star of the show. It is a great place for both solitary and collective pleasures.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c18f54dc13e8c0dde30""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, Coffee & Tea, Food"",""business_id"":""VHWCzIZXpWPyeFe2lkIutQ"",""name"":""Johnson Hall Coffee House""}]"

Prices are reasonable and the food is always on point. They offer a wide variety of delicious meals to choose from. My usual go to is the two item combo with a crispy chicken taco and enchilada. I finally tried the mole enchilada and I think it's my new favorite here! The sauce is semi-sweet and mildly spicy filled with grilled chicken and cheese. I'm not one to finish my meals but it was so good I cleaned my plate. I also recommend the ceviche, it's made with fresh halibut and it's perfect on a hot day. 

My girlfriend let me sample her Camarones Guajillo and the shrimp was cooked perfectly! I loved the buttery, sweet & semi-spicy sauce it was marinated in. 

Free chips are served here and they have a great salsa bar. 

Beverages: They serve soda, horchata, beer, and wine.

2 Adults

Atmosphere - 4 stars
Food - 5 stars
Service - 5 stars

Background - Time for lunch and stuck away from the house.  I do love my Triple D, Dinners, Drive in and Dives, restaurants and shockingly never been here before. 

Atmosphere - First time to restaurant and clearly set up for the COVID era we live in now.  Only two tables be used.  Pretty basic but what you need from a BBQ joint.

Food
Lunch - I had the Carolina Style Pulled Pork, which came with two sides.  I went with the hushpuppies and house pickles.  Oh my so many pickles as you get a few on the side with the meal too, along with cornbread.  I wish I had ordered a double of hushpuppies.  I picked the Carolina mustard sauce which was served in a tiny little cup but was the perfect amount for a quarter pound of that delicious pork.  Mustard and pork are made for each other.  The pork was a little dry without the sauce, I had to try a little without the sauce.

My wife's lunch - She had the St. Louis style ribs with moonshine bbq sauce.  Her sauce container was much larger of the 5 ribs she ordered.  The sauce was a little sweet which I expected from moonshine.  I am a fan of St. Louis ribs because of the Sparks ribfest and these did not disappoint.  She had a side of coleslaw which reminded us of KFC's when we were kids. 

Service - Ordering online is simple, no special app needed just a web browser.  Just do not forget to add the meal to the basket.  I did that the first time.  Like I said earlier that I wish I could have ordered double hushpuppies but you use a check box to indicate your choices for your two sides.  An extra line is not added when you make your selection, if you wanted the same side twice.  Once your order is submitted it gives you a time when it will ready for pick up.  They actually texted me when it was ready.  The only drawback there was a guy ordering his lunch and took forever for him to complete his order, he could not decide.  But cannot blame the business for that.

Future - Yes please.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c18f54dc13e8c0dde8c""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Barbeque, Soul Food, Southern"",""business_id"":""3ucn3_cDf1WV0DsFgoTfyQ"",""name"":""Carolina Kitchen & Barbeque""}]"

Background - My friend invited me to a basketball game Lawlor Event Center.  It is easier to eat near campus and thought this would be a good choice.

Atmosphere - Located on north side of campus, sharing the building with Cane's.  It is a very new building.  The colors inside pop with the self-advertising.   Seating is typically fast food.  Small tables with seats.

Food
  Dinner - A great variety of sandwiches to choose from.  I ordered from the Go Crazy section of the menu, which is a little higher in price.  They do have happy hour prices for students from 2 - 5pm for $7, Monday through Friday.  I had the Matt Cain with their World Famous Dutch bread.  I do not know about world famous but is was dang tasty.  I love Roast Beef subs so the Matt Cain caught my eye, which also included Beef Salami, Turkey, with Godfather sauce, which when I read that sauces name I heard in good fellas voice, then finished off with provolone.  Yeah the sandwich was on the expensive side but they do not slack on any of the ingredients.  To me it was worth every bite.

Service - Pretty basic but that is all you need.  You order at the register, they ask if you about the other items on the sub.  When they are done making your sub they call your name.   The wait for the sub is not bad considering how much they put into it.

Armature Works is not a new concept in modern day living, but it IS one of the most well executed that I've ever seen. 

It is basically a mall for restaurants, like a food court on steroids without all the anchor stores like Macy's, Dillard's, JC Penney, etc. Seems that many cities have began to adopt this urban modernization. Here in metro Atlanta we have three similar places: Ponce City Market and Krog Street Market as well as the much older and less trendy Sweet Aurburn Market. All of which have multiple restaurants with a few kitschy shops peppered in.  


[ HISTORY ]

This is all part of Tampa's revitalization project going on all along the Hillsboro River. It seemingly began with the creation of a Riverwalk near Curtis Hixon Park in 1976. Here the city installed wooden planks that were replaced in 1989 with granite pavers. By 2010 many new city parks, hotels and other business began to shape and revitalize the riverfront. Curtis Hixon was upgraded to a lovely water font park and by 2014, Water Works Park was completed further upstream. Soon after the gorgeous restaurant known as Uelele opened near Water Works Park with a beautiful view of the Hillsborough River right at a bend, allowing views both up & downstream. It is here where the story of Armature Works begins. 

It was once the storage and maintenance facility for Tampa Electric's (TECO) streetcars and simple known as THE BARN. Bet ya didn't know Tampa once upon a time had street cars like the ones still found in New Orleans did ya? Developers Chas Bruck and Adam Harden of SoHo Capital have purposefully kept the feel of Armature Works authentic by allowing the original exposed brick walls, skylights, windows and doors to remain. They even reused the old roof as hardwood flooring throughout this 73,000 square foot mixed-use space.


[ TAMPA'S NEWEST HOT SPOT ] 

Armature Works is best described as a place where food lovers can gather in a super trendy and comfy foodie utopia. A gallery of restaurants serving everything from ramen and Cuban sandwiches to BBQ, pizza and wine with brie. You can even pamper your taste buds with a $78 Tomahawk Ribeye (32oz) found @ Steelbach.

There are plenty of seating areas both inside and out. Some are very intimate while others are communal. There is a central exterior atrium known as 'The Courtyard' with more seating as well as a riverfront lawn complete with giant checkerboards and synthetic grass. 

Those of you looking for a wedding or event venue will find plenty.
Four spaces known as the Theater, The Gathering, the Social Hall and the Social Room are available for rent as well as TWO Rooftop Gardens. If all that weren't enough there is a place called SHOW & TELL, a full demonstration kitchen & entertainment workshop designed to host a variety of events. This place is insanely well done!!!


[ FOODS TO TRY ]

Cubano @ Hemingway's
Cheeseburger Empanada @ Empamamas
Chicken Paitan Ramen @ Ichicoro Imoto
Korean Philly @ BNB


[ ENTERTAINMENT ] 

On the 2nd Wednesday of every month from 6:00pm - 9:00pm a 'Night Market' will feature a rotating cast of artisanal artists and makers selling handmade goods, jewelry, art, wood-work, gifts, etc. A free family-friendly event featuring live music. 


[ FINAL THOUGHTS ]

Armature Works makes me feel happy and privileged to be alive in this era of human development. It combines so much of what I love: Nature, water, outdoor beauty, historic significance, a welcoming décor, clever & creative uses of materials/items, and a AMAZING variety of foods all while cultivating a family-friendly community environment. All it need now is a covered bridge and my own personal view of heaven would be complete.

7edDFDu29KzpET2XtHWtfg,6yGZ9RMMcW2-sKmnbIWbmw,5,67,"4.5 stars on its way to 5 BIG stars! Variety, recipes, prices, & service will see to it! This new rising star replaces the former Heritage American Bistro that had opened for a brief period (to excellent reviews). Unfortunately for the bistro & its charming owners, the timing of its conception coincided w/ the onset of Covid & Covid restrictions. American Heritage closed its doors for Tampa Taco Co. to be born. (This Mexican restaurant is open all days but Tuesdays & Thursdays.) 

Do NOT be misled by the business name. This establishment is SO MUCH MORE than a standard taco eatery. Appetizers include Chips & Guac, Chips & Queso, Mashed Potato Tacos, Elotes, Nachos, Quesadillas, Sopes, & Flautas. Available daily entrees offered are *Tacos ($2.75), Burritos ($8.50), Tortas ($8), Chimichangas ($9.50), & Tostadas ($3.50). The WEEKEND BRUNCH entrees are as follows: Chilaquiles, Huevos Rancheros, Breakfast Burito & Breakfast Tacos, Pancakes (varies depending upon the day), Biscuit & Gravy, & a Breakfast Bowl. (*Available taco varieties: fish, shrimp, veggie, pork, beef, & chicken)

The married owners/chefs, Aliana & Cesar (see pic), are worthy partners. Hailing from the Dominican Republic & Puerto Rico/Mexico, they met in culinary school @ Johnson & Whales in Miami. A protégé, Aliana's father owns Zacatacos (5 Mexican eateries) in Chicago, & has assisted in the transformation of Heritage American Bistro to Tampa Taco Co. Even Aliana's grandmother has had a hand in the makeover; you can thank her for the rice & sauces.

This clean restaurant offers many outside seats on the covered patio-- see pic. It's a perfect location for social distancing or for a dinner out w/ a favorite canine. 

The large chalk menu is readily visible on the back wall. It lists the daily offerings as well as the Saturday & Sunday brunch entrees. Prices are low for the quality & quality of food you'll receive. 

This talented couple is the epitome of the American dream, & one (like many) who are trying hard to survive the perils of 2020. I ordered three entrees to sample (& feed to my refrigerator shelves:). 

The Tres Leches Pancakes (recommended by wonderfully friendly Chris) was my favorite entree of the day. For $7.00, I was treated to a large stack of deliciously flavorful & fluffy buttermilk pancakes topped w/ a generous heaping of whipped topping. The $8 Breakfast Burito was quite good; for me, it would have been even better if a sauce had accompanied it. And the creative & a little spicy Chilaquiles @ $9 was the most interesting dish; I loved the thick cheese that topped it & I enjoyed the crunch of the tortillas that served as its base. I like different, & it was something I've never found at another Mexican restaurant. 

I will definitely return to try a basic taco, although I'm unsure if this talented culinary duo can produce just ""basic."" They simply have too much talent, potential, & ambition. Please don't take my word for it-- drive over to check out this wonderful addition to Lutz/Land 'O Lakes & the surrounding areas. 

Just a short drive from North Tampa & Wesley Chapel, your palate & wallet will have no regrets. Mine definitely didn't! I'll be back:-)","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0dfb27""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Mexican, Restaurants, Tacos"",""business_id"":""6yGZ9RMMcW2-sKmnbIWbmw"",""name"":""Tampa Taco Company""}]"

If you're wondering (and I was) the weekend brunch options are basically the same on both Saturdays and Sundays (I asked).

I really enjoyed the all you can eat brunch as a whole and though I didn't try every single item, I certainly enjoyed what I tried. My favorite items were the roast prime rib and the fried potatoes. If there had been a roasted vegetable and a popover, it would have been a classic ""Sunday Roast."" I was hoping they'd have a Caesar salad option, but not all wishes come true. None the less, the offerings were still very, very good- in fact it was one of the best brunch buffets I've ever attended, including the one at Lacroix! 
The pot de creme chocolate was delicious, especially with the fresh berries. I also enjoyed the smoked salmon/bagel option. 

We also ordered a bottle of sparkling wine to mix with the OJ and GFJ options included with the brunch which also included iced or hot coffee or iced or hot tea(unlimited). All of this was $28/person. The bottle of sparkling wine was $44. For Center City, these prices are great!

And unlike a lot of the all you can eat places, the quality of the food was excellent. I usually know afterward by how thirsty I am. And since I'm not thirsty at all, I think that means the food wasn't full of preservatives and other cheap flavor enhancers to make up for quality. I thought the smoked salmon was not at all over the top salty which made it extra yummy. I took lots of photos. There was something for everyone on that brunch buffet and I recommend it to everyone who likes to eat. 

Re. Photos, I didn't capture everything served on the brunch menu. So there will be a few fun surprises when it's your turn to experience H&C weekend brunch!

Service:
One of the highlights of the day was the gentleman who served the prime rib and also made the waffles. I should have asked him his name! He was outstanding! With a great personality, he hand sliced with perfection! He was also very nice and professional and I could tell he took pride in his work! He really enjoyed it and when you feel that, it makes the whole experience that much better! He's a keeper!!! I see great things for his future!

Adam our server was terrific and there was plenty of support staff to grab our empty plates. I noticed they got pretty aggressive near the end and not as attentive at the beginning which felt not so great; especially since we still had half of a bottle of wine to drink when they started hanging about us. So it felt a bit presumptive. If they really wanted us to go, perhaps they should have refilled our glasses with the wine instead of attempting to snatch our plates away before we were finished. That would have been a more diplomatic approach and its not easy for everyone to pour their own wine. 

In spite of that one not so fun issue, it was a great  experience and again I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys brunch or just enjoys food.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e2df5""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Active Life, Nightlife, Bars, American (Traditional), Bowling, Restaurants, American (New), Gastropubs"",""business_id"":""CYSPKiVdoPX3erovujnE9Q"",""name"":""Harp & Crown""}]"

Mind you, this isn't a place that you can just walk into and grab a doughnut. This is a pop-up as of now but I'm hoping they find a permanent location in the near future. I know they would do very well here. They accept online pre-orders on Thursdays beginning at noon. Check out their website to order at: 
https://www.mordoughnuts.com/ 
Pick-up is on Saturday & Sunday and you can choose the time slot they offer. You get 4 Mochi doughnuts for only $12! I thought that was a great deal for what you get. 

Picking up my order was easy. There was a sign on the sidewalk pointing me into the driveway and into the parking lot. So curbside pick-up is the only way to get these right now. Don't forget to wear a mask! 

Each week 4 different flavors are offered. My order consisted of Guava, Black Sesame, Milk & Cereal, and Matcha Wonderland. The Guava was my favorite but then again I'm a fan of all things Guava. The black sesame had a slight smoky, nutty flavor. Milk & Cereal was sweet, creamy and totally reminded me of eating an actual bowl of cereal. The Matcha Wonderland reminded me of drinking matcha tea but the flavor was very subtle. 

I couldn't get over the texture of these! Definitely not your average doughnut. These were very light and chewy just like a Mochi. It was suggested that if we didn't eat them right away to leave the box slightly ajar so they kept their texture. But we ate them right away so all was good. 

It was fun trying each flavor with my son. We cut each one in half and reviewed them by taste in the car lol. Overall kid and mama approved! I can't wait to see what other flavors they offer.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0df5ff""},""stars"":""5"",""categories"":""Pop-Up Restaurants, Restaurants, Food, Donuts"",""business_id"":""12Gc4OFQ-WAW0fAk2hRZuQ"",""name"":""Kin Bakeshop""}]"
-bO3LNibnUfUGta8EWtJXw,XuQ5ekbJ9eRUX06JTqJHaQ,5,111,"There are over 100 restaurants to eat at in downtown St. Petersburg. Fortunately my friend had a knack for finding the best places. Actually everyone we talked to in St. Petersburg loves this restaurant. Florida Trend magazine named them ""Best New Restaurant in Florida."" They have  this location in St. Pete and one in South Tampa. After touring the Dali Museum we headed over for lunch. 

The Mill has been open for seven years.. Their menu was created by Tampa Bay native chef Ted Dorsey, formerly of Castille Restaurant at Hotel Zamora. Chef Dorsey describes the menu as ""rustic Americana with a Southern touch and a French Creole twist."" The Mill took over over the location of the former Jo Jo's Citta, a longtime Italian restaurant. Interior designer Amanda McMahon was hired to design The Mill. Many of the items in the restaurant were purchased at a vintage market. The restaurant has an industrial steam punk vibe. The 3D wall murals by renowned local artist Istavan Torok. There are gears on the wall and the servers wear the kinds of aprons welders would wear. The sink in the bathroom is a tiny vintage bathtub. At The Mill they offer both indoor and outdoor dining. We arrived on Valentines Day and they were packed. We had the choice of waiting an hour for a table or finding a space at the bar and it just so happened that there were two seats waiting for us. It must have been fate.

The Mill is well known for their watermelon bruschetta. Our hotel, the Avalon actually had free coupons for this menu item. If only we had known, oh well. I started off with a refreshing mimosa while we looked over the menu. They serve inventive cocktails, beer, and wine. The brunch menu had sliders, salads, and small and big plates. We decided to share the spreads and breads ($9.50) that came with three dips along with bread and chips. My favorite was the caramelized French onion but the pimento cheese and the roasted red pepper honey hummus were also very good and I didn't even think I liked hummus. My favorite dipper was their homemade potato chips. For lunch my friend I both ordered the Southern Bell Salad ($7.50). The salad had romaine, red onions, sage derby, peppadews, dried apricots, southern fried chicken, and honeycup vinaigrette. This salad was amazing. The chicken was so hot and crunchy. I loved when I got a bite of it with that fantastic sage derby cheese. Hands down the best salad I've had in a long time.

Our server was David. He was a super nice guy but we had to wait a long time for service. Part of the problem was the cocktails that he was making took a long time. He was also slammed because of the holiday. Another part of the problem was that every 10 minutes or so he had to jump up on top of the bar to fix something that was making it rain water down onto the bar. He was part bartender, part maintenance man. I think they finally got it fixed as we were leaving. Normally I don't mind lingering over a meal but we had a packed day ahead of us and we wanted to get to several other places. A nice touch while we were eating was when the manager went around and gave all of the ladies a carnation for Valentines Day. I am glad I got a chance to dine at The Mill. Next time I would make a reservation.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e299d""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Breakfast & Brunch, American (New), Bars, Lounges, Restaurants, Nightlife"",""business_id"":""XuQ5ekbJ9eRUX06JTqJHaQ"",""name"":""The Mill Restaurant""}]"

THE SCENE
I started a talk thread in Tampa about 1 month before my visit asking the natives of the city to give me their favorite restaurant recommendations. The Tampa community was gracious and overwhelmed me with options. One suggestion in particular caught my eye (thank you Coty S). After checking the reviews and pics, it was clear this place is a must. After all, how often could you ever say you ate on the grounds of a Buddhist Temple with real live monks walking around. 

We decided to meet a few yelpers here that would definitely appreciate the quirky and unusual setting. I've shared compliments with Brian S from Rhode Island often, but we've never met in person before today. You may know him from his many lighthouse, public parks and library reviews. He is also one of only a few yelpers worldwide with over 65,000 compliments (which makes him sort of yelp famous). He, along with the Scruffy Tourist that appears in so many of his pics spent the day with us here and also at Fort DeSoto afterwards. It was a fabulous day filled with good food and good company... even though it was so cold outside that I saw a politician with his hands in his OWN pockets.

**********
 
HOW IT WORKS HERE
First, I was advised to be here by 10:30am on Sunday morning, but it would actually have been better to be here by 10am and wait for the different businesses to open. Some of the lines get REALLY long, especially for the pho soup.
  
The setup is mostly outdoors, so take that into consideration when planning your visit. It was really cold today and although the vending areas were covered, the plastic shielded the wind but not the temps. There is a large enclosed barn-like eating area, but most areas for eating are picnic tables surrounding the building. 

TIP - Each vendor has their own line, so it might be wise to split up if you are with a group and have each person go different vendors to order.

**********

THE FOOD
* I enjoyed fried chicken wings at a place specializing in curry chicken that was freakin' incredible! I can't tell you the name of the place to save my life, but it was the only place I saw serving fried chicken wings. Follow your nose and you'll find this vendor!

* MY FIRST PHO experience turns out not to be pho at all :-(   Another yelper informed me it was just beef noodle soup, but Pho or not it was well worth the wait and so delicious! My only regret is that I 
A) should have got the larger noodles instead of the angel hair ones and 
B) If I had known I would have requested no cilantro. I hate cilantro! Otherwise this noodle soup was amazeballs.

* Curry Pumpkin Chicken near the noodle soup vendor was incredible. All kinds of moaning was going on as we sampled food from 5 different vendors (probably a dozen more that we missed). I was truly as happy as a tornado in a trailer park!

* The fried banana's and fried sweet potatoes HOT out of the frier were delicious. You haven't had anything until you've had these! You get a HUGE bag for just $5. Matter of fact, most everything here was $5 and the portions were Ginormous. The only exception were the egg rolls (located between the soup and curry pumpkin chicken vendor). They were $1 each and they were so good we ordered a dozen.

**********

THE VERDICT
I lost my mind at Wat Mongkolratanaram and I need to go back as soon as possible to find it (lol).  I plan to come here EVERY SUNDAY I'm in the Tampa area visiting to indulge myself in the best food experience ever created. This place is amazing and I am forever grateful to the Tampa yelp community for suggesting it!!!!    

Nothing fancy, nothing pretentious, just good food, great prices in a festive atmosphere where total strangers come together like old friends. This is by far my favorite yelp find of the year 2012.

I suggest adding some zesty giardiniera & melted Mozzarella cheese...or in Portillo's terms....""hot with mozz"". The Hot Dog with ""Everything"" includes yellow mustard, neon green relish, celery salt, freshly chopped onions, sliced red ripened tomatoes, a hefty kosher pickle spear and hot sport peppers piled high into a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun.

birqhk03AYjec-mDAk9sEA,EUjrGTbA69NUnXifTBE43w,5,57,"It's my first time eating at the Ahtti Korean Munchies food truck and I can't wait for them to come back so I can explore everything on their menu. None of the guests today seem to have that ""munchies"" in the marijuana sense of the word, but we're in front of a Morgan Stanley financial services building, so it's pretty buttoned up. :) 

First thing I liked: They are FAST. I made it through the line and had my food in under 5 minutes. You'd think every food truck would be like that, but I waited 25 minutes for a 10-inch pizza in the same spot yesterday.  

And the food ... yum! It didn't hurt that both items I ordered had fried chicken in 'em.  

One recommendation for Ahtti: More soda selection. I'm still on a sugar high from that Pepsi I drank (they had water, Pepsi, and Sprite ... I saw nothing else). But a small quibble. Now back to the good stuff!

First, I got some Mandoo (Korean dumplings): Soft, just doughy enough, a nice light brown on it, not too hot, and a perfect mix of veggies and fried chicken bits. 

Then my main course: Holy Moly Tacos. I chose fried chicken as my meat, and the tortillas were filled with said meat, along with veggies, lettuce, and a sweet and savory mix of their secret sauces.  Great taste in every bite ... it made me long for more.

Completely exciting, different, superbly executed non-Americanized Middle Eastern Food.

Swooping into the city of Brotherly Love and getting a strong recommendation to visit Lips and I curiously  reached Zahav almost on time. 
I won't go into the flowery description. Just that this was very enjoyed.
We were greeted warmly at the door. I observed this wasn't just because of possibly being recognized. The staff goes out of their way to work as a team with great sincerity. The place was packed, however the noise level was not a factor.

Listing the Plates:

Hummus with garlic and olive Oil. Excellent, light with the most delectable Israeli Bread.
Yemenite brisket, onions, fresh chickpeas A bit salty, fantastic Brisket Flavor, served HOT! 
Fried salt cod, tasty fresh and moist
Sweetbreads, Too much Breading. Dissapointing
Grilled duck hearts, I know what your thinking, Try this, I have never had this before however this was a treat. The Muscle itself absorbs whatever sauce its cooked with,
Crispy lamb's tongue, good a bit dry, basically tastes like a Lamb Chop.
Merguez ground lamb,Strong Lamb Taste, tender and moist
Hanger steak, Excellent, moist, cook a tad less than Mid Rare.

Dessert was ok, a bit skimpy, coffee could have been served hotter.

Service was close to perfection, well trained, knowledgeable.

AGzDVNk33hdpRdtcu-r71w,j8feOxyJqlIJWOi8su2qzw,5,61,"Serial Grillers is the real deal! After seeing the name pop up on Food Network, Forbes, and the Cooking Channel, I could not miss the opportunity to visit the infamous restaurant while visiting Tucson. Serial Grillers came about from two brothers who had the idea of doing something a little different with their favorite foods, which includes cheesesteaks, calzones and pizza. And different is definitely what they did. The restaurant is a little hole in the wall with no flashy signage. Upon walking in, the medium sized dining area has some cool wall art and a self serve soda station. After checking out the menu and consulting with the employees, I decided on the Hannibal cheesesteak. 

The Hannibal cheesesteak was delivered about ten minutes after ordering and it was worth the wait. Topped with ribeye, grilled onions, hot cherry peppers, sweet peppers, tomatoes, pickles and white american cheese, this sandwich was a sight for sore eyes. Although it sounds super spicy, it was actually the perfect amount of spicy and savory. The ribeye was tender and juicy, the hot cherry peppers and sweet peppers balanced one another out perfectly the the cheese was just the right amount. Each sandwich does come with either a choice of potato salad or coleslaw. I opted for the potato salad which was served in a little cup of starchy goodness. It was a little salty for my taste, but still super flavorful. 

If you are looking for a quick, tasty and affordable meal, this is the place for you. The cheesesteak was perfectly prepared, perfectly portioned and perfectly seasoned. Though I wish they opened one of these in LA, I fear that it would not be the same. Visiting Serial Grillers is a nice treat when visiting the area. The restaurant offers table service; you order your food at the register and take a number to your table where the food is delivered to you.

The dishes were tasty and delicious! Loved everything we ordered. The fried prawns were huge lightly crisped batter fried until golden brown... one of life's simplest pleasures! It came with homemade sweet sour sauce. Addicting! Not all fried rice are created equal but I loved their fried rice! Plenty of pork and other ingredients! The sizzling rice soup was perfect for the chill weather... yummy comfort food!

If you are familiar wiith Los Agaves this place is operated by the same great team and the newest addition in restaurants by Carlos Luna. I had expected it to be jam packed when we arrived but luckily we were able to get seats at the beautiful bar area right away. It's always fun sitting at the bar socializing with the bartender. Sean was great and he created some awesome hand crafted cocktails! 

I started with the Margarita Picante which was perfectly made! You have the choice of fresno mezcal or serrano tequila. I went with the serrano tequila and really enjoyed it. This drink is made with agave nectar, lime, and has a rim with chipotle salt. 

My second drink of choice was La Paloma Clasica and again stuck with the tequila but you do have the option of mezcal as well. If you are a fan of grapefruit order this! It was very light and refreshing and didn't have a bitter taste as grapefruit can be.

As for the food I decided on the pulpo tacos. The serving presentation was great all around but once I took that first bite I was let down by the overcooked octopus. It was rubbery, chewy, and the flavor was lacking. I debated a good while on sending it back since I don't like to insult the cooks but I couldn't just waste my meal so I sent it back and management was kind and gracious enough to accept it and thanked me for letting them know. Hence the five stars!

Meal Tip: If you are not satisfied with your food please don't hesitate to let them know! They are all about making the customer happy.

I was able to replace my meal and decided to stick with something I know and went with the Mole Poblano. I've had the mole at Los Agaves and knew it wouldn't let me down. This meal includes a grilled butterflied chicken breast served over their delicious mole poblano, and their signature pyramid shaped Mexican rice and black beans in the cute little tostada shell.

The Empanadas de Camaron is a must try! These were perfectly cooked and the filling of shrimp and cheese melted in my mouth. A great appetizer to start with. My friend also ordered the Ceviche Verde which she let me try and it was just as good. The fish was tender and the green sauce (cilantro basil) was very flavorful.

How does this place compare to Los Agaves? I would say it has the same great taste and flavors but with a twist. Most of the choices on the menu do look familiar but they are different and the choices of seafood are expanded. 

Overall I'm excited we have a new restaurant that's clearly here to stay. The location is within walking distance from the Funk Zone and a few blocks from our beautiful beach.

Here, excellence isn't just about food, but really about the entire experience from the moment you walk in the door until you walk out.  The servers attend to you with Southern grace, and every detail of your seating is to create that special ambiance and romance.

I will say that despite their best efforts, there were flaws.  For one, drinks took an eternity to come, and luckily arrived just before the first course.  Our dessert and nightcap drinks also took more than a 1/2hr to come!  And moving on to the food and drinks, clearly some are better than others...

1. Tequila Mockingbird 2 $13 ""an original creation of Commanders... we liked this drink so much we named it twice. tequila and lemoncello combine to create a tart treat you so nice you'll order it twice"":  Refreshing and very tart.  Smooth.  Good tasting though not complex.  7/10

2. Kessler Riesling 6oz $11.50

3. Garlic Bread (complimentary):  Soaked in butter.  Did not skimp on the garlic, and there's tons of spices and cheese.  7/10

4. Cast Iron Seared Redfish Cake $13 ""blackened redfish cake with shaved winter vegetable salad, peppery argula & rum barrel hot sauce aioli"":  Resembles a high-end crab cake, but substituting fish.  Soft, yet many textures including julienned vegetables.  Creamy consistency, with some horseradish. 8/10

5. Turtle Soup $8.50 ""a Commander's classic finished tableside with dry sherry"":  Can't come here and not get this.  Just do it.  No, it is not amazing tasting.  The turtle is really dry for one.  Though, that sherry does add quite a bit of complexity.  Well, just gotta try it.  7/10

6. Caramelized Pumpkin Salad $9.50 ""Covey Rise Farm pumpkins with petite greens, Belgian endive, pecan tuile, brandy soaked grapes with artisan cheese and Satsuma-cane syrup vinaigrette"":  Delicious!  Crisp vegetables against sweet pumpkin and fruit.  Love all the sweet crispy things on top too!  10/10

7. Pecan Crusted Gulf Fish $39 ""a Commander's Palace classic with crushed corn cream, spiced pecans, petite herbs and prosecco poached Louisiana blue crab"":  Well, I'd have to say, it's a ton better than I was expecting.  Often nut crusted fish just ends up with a dry and hard breading.  But in this case, they kept the pecans light, and was not offensive.  The sauce is a bit sweet and very rich.  The fish flesh was pretty good, but was just a tad tough and could stand to be cooked less.  8/10

8. South Louisiana Seafood Stew $36 ""a rich seafood stew of Gulf fish, poached local oysters, wild white shrimp, a popcorn rice boudin cake, with a charred tomato-chili broth and roasted trinity garnish"":  Well, I kinda object to the name--this wasn't a ""stew"" at all.  I mean, I guess they can say the sauce is a stew.  Anyway, the fish is savory with a crisp skin.  Some flavorful mysteries in there too.  Loved how perfectly the oysters were cooked, nearly raw but just enough, and ultra tender.  The oysters paired really well with the rest of the dish.  6/10

9. Sweet Potato Milk Punch $9.50 ""we combine milk and vanilla to a perfect balance of creamy goodness. next, house-made spiced rum spiked with sweet potato is the kick you won't want to miss"":  AWFUL.  Cannot taste of that sweet potato whatsoever.  Tastes pretty much like sugar and milk mixed with alcohol.  Perhaps a super watered-down egg nog?  2/10

10. Limoncello $5

11. Lally's Praline Parfait $8.50 ""hand-crafted vanilla ice cream layered in an old fashioned parfait glass with candied pecans and sticky praline syrup, Lally Brennan's favorite dessert"":  OH GOD... perhaps best sundae I've EVER had!?  So luscious.  That house-made ice cream is decadently luxurious, and paired with the pralines... heavenly!  10/10

12. Commander's Bread Pudding Souffle $9.50 ""all the richness of Creole bread pudding whipped up into a light souffle, finished tableside with warm whiskey cream"":  Hmm, this one is tough.  It's not really a ""souffle.""  More like bread pudding with meringue on top.  Really mushy bread pudding.  My gf didn't like it.  But personally it worked for me.  It was served really hot, and the sauce clearly had plenty of alcohol.  Most bread puddings are too... bready.  But I think this dessert made good use of the bread.  8/10

So, there were mishaps, and not everything was the best example of cooking.  But overall, it was a beautiful night at a very special restaurant.

5/5

qIWTF542DQ08zamCmyZIdQ,U3grYFIeu6RgAAQgdriHww,5,75,"After a Holiday traffic nightmare on the road, we decided to just get off the 101 rest and wait out the craziness. Brophy Bros. is a Santa Barbara landmark and usually stop in when we are in the area. They open at 11 am and is constantly packed with locals and tourists. The main dinning room / bar is not large and they do have outside seating on the terrace with a bar downstairs too. Brophy Bros. is a seafood raw bar restaurant and IMO has the best clam chowder in Santa Barbara. Its chunky with tons of chopped clams. On our recent visit we ordered the following:

Seafood combo comes with ceviche, shrimp, oysters and clams
Little Neck clams on the half shell
Fried Calamari
A big bowl of the clam chowder.

The raw clams and oysters were very fresh and the hot fried calamari was excellent. The ceviche was however hard to eat spread out on the iced seafood combo plate. 

The restaurant is loud and high energy. There is parking spaces around the restaurant but they are hard to come by. So there is a large City parking lot right next to the center.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e28b3""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Cocktail Bars, Fish & Chips, Nightlife, Seafood, Restaurants, Bars"",""business_id"":""U3grYFIeu6RgAAQgdriHww"",""name"":""Brophy Bros - Santa Barbara""}]"
lRq5TPMPIjlxkHfvgfGMyg,j5siJykDq7GWzgSdpOjhdw,5,108,"My dearest Anna - It is with immense pleasure that I have the opportunity to write to you once again. As you know, one score and fifteen years hath passed since we were tasked with locating and mapping out the Nation's finest burger establishments. The journey has been long and arduous to say the least. Our current expedition started late last spring out west in California Territory and took us through the Republic of Texas by mid summer before finally arriving here in Confederate Territory last fall. There was no shortage of spectacular and noteworthy finds along the trail. It was however here, in the outpost of Nashville (Cumberland River Valley), that our eyes were awakened to a truly special establishment by name of Jack Brown's. It is our understanding that there is more than one location of Jack Brown's out here in this part of the country, but you'd never know by the atmosphere, hospitality and service we found here at this location. 

I cannot recall ever, a tougher time making a decision than here at Jack Brown's. Never have I seen a burger list where every one sounded so desirable. With much deliberation I went with the Cobra Kai. I suspected these Southerners were just confused as I've never seen cream cheese on a burger prior. Confused and lucky perhaps; I do not know, but the cream cheese is truly a magnificent touch. The cream cheese combined with jalapeños (a pepper brought up from Mexican Territory) and jalapeño jelly made for a burger that will not be soon forgotten. I cannot even begin to explain the abundance of flavor I witnessed. The beef, a USDA Prime 100% Wagyu sourced from Snake River Farms in Fort Boise (Oregon Territory), was absolutely remarkable. The quality of the beef makes an undeniable difference. From my seat, belied up to the bar, I watched as cookie masterfully prepared the beef on a flattop (undoubtedly smuggled down from the North). Each side of the burger was seared and specially seasoned before going under the steaming dish for final preparation. The bun was perfectly toasted while the toppings were all well appointed. The sight of this burger alone reassured my belief in this expedition. Dare I say that the flavors were mighty as the Mississippi. As with all of the burgers here, things got messy in a hurry, but no one seamed to mind. 

While here I also partook in a sampling they refer to as the Greg Brady. We are not sure who this Greg fellow is, but surely he must be a southern dignitary of sorts. The Greg Brady is topped with mac n' cheese and barbecue potato chips. Let me just say - Whoa nelly little momma!  I also had a sampling of The Ponch (possibly the moniker of one of their yellow-bellied Generals) a burger topped with a house-made guacamole (smashed and seasoned avocados from California Territory), applewood smoked bacon, white cheddar cheese and Sriracha mayo. Again, a burger that will absolutely delight your taste buds and leave you longing for more. 

While the burgers are the priority, it should be noted that I partook in a side offering of fries that should not be slept on. The fries are a Yukon Gold, crinkle cut variety that was fried to a perfect golden crisp with nary a soggy one among the bunch. They don't cheat you none on the portion size either. Then there's the fry sauce; different than any other I've encountered, I have no idea of how it is concocted (possibly mayo, ketchup, mustard and other spices) but will swear to you, it is heavenly. 

If it were possible, we'd just remain in camp here and eat Jack Brown's burgers night and day throughout the rest of winter. Unfortunately, we must continue on though. I have sent letters back to the President, bestowing a top recommendation for Jack Brown's Beer & Burger Joint. The Chief would be crazy to not immediately get down here and witness this one for himself. 

With new sense of untold vigor, the troops have been rallied once again and we are homeward ho. Baring any further orders from the President or trouble crossing Indian Territory, please expect me by the onset of spring. 

My thoughts, my prayers and all my love be upon you. 

Sincerely,

Col. Jarrod R., 7th Calvary Regiment","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1cf54dc13e8c0e23b8""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""American (Traditional), Nightlife, Food, Restaurants, Bars, Burgers, Beer, Wine & Spirits"",""business_id"":""j5siJykDq7GWzgSdpOjhdw"",""name"":""Jack Brown's Beer & Burger Joint""}]"
fKtb3o6_52VPssKbvyWptw,dclL14pr7OojCOKJ_ZbMbQ,5,56,"This weekend after a lovely brunch my Yelp pal Shannon S. took me in a walk to another neighborhood family business that has over 120 years of New Orleans goodness. 

This place is a wonderful Sicilian bakery that was originally established in 1905 in the French Quarter by Angelo Brocato, Sr. The local Italian residents Quarter would come early every morning with their warm bread to dip in Angelo's freshly-made granita al limone for breakfast. (lemon ice) They still make their famous lemon ice today and have been in their current, N Carrollton Ave location, since the 80's. I've heard that they have an outlet at the airport too. 

So when you walk in you immediately get the sense of stroking back in time, it's set up like an old apothecary from years gone by. The smells, well you gotta be there, oh my. They are well known for everything they make, it's authentic and just done right. Their gelato, ice creams, cakes, cappuccino and if course lemon ice are legendary and I am already looking forward to my next visit. 

I had a cannoli, almond biscotti and couple if cookies and can attest to the amazing flavors that they put into the authentic Sicilian delicious sweets. I'm a cannoli lover and I can honestly say that theirs is perfect, I'm talking cannoli heaven! 

Their expresso machine is iconic and Shannon tells a funny story about the annual machine cleaning when people are Jonsing for their expresso for a week or so LOL

You can find their goodies all around the greater Nawlins area in local markets and grocery stores that carry their pre-packed ices and gelato, cannolis and biscotti! yum!

Read about their rich history and tradition and resilience after hurricane Katrina when their shop was under 5' of water:

My friend and I requested their terrace seating so it was a little bit of a wait, but not as long as some of the other restaurants we went to this trip. Anyways, their terrace is a great place to take photos from that really highlight the NOLA vibes. My friend was a little nervous because the terrace didn't exactly seem the most steady/ sturdy, but it was an experience nevertheless (take that how you will)! 

Anyways, our server was great. He was really honest when we were asking for recommendations and for him to basically choose for us, which I greatly appreciated. I ordered the blackened chicken sandwich with a side of hush puppies, and for dessert I had the brownie a la mode.

ch2KEagZ6yKnRFvq-LG8qA,pKWCgqQkKpumlgmbSLYX6Q,5,85,"A perfect place to be on Thank You Thursday! Seldom does this non-sandwich person love a shop whose speciality is sandwiches & the like, but Moody Judy's is NOT your ordinary shop. Once you enter through the glass doorway, you'll feel as though you're stepping back in time. 

Not only is Moody Judy not ""moody,"" but this New York dimpled native is downright friendly & ever so sweet. Even had she not referred to me as ""adorable,"" ""cute,"" & then stated that I look much younger than my age, her 2.5-year-old shoppe would easily earn 5 stars. I set my bias aside:)

Moody Judy's menu includes 5 salads, MANY sandwiches (see menu pic), 11 hotdog varieties, & 6 sides. There's even a ""Secret Menu"" on the counter that offers up 13 additional dogs! 

I counted twenty-six flavors of ice-cream, along w/ a no sugar added variety! Yes, 26! (The menu notes 30 flavors, including VEGAN & dairy free.) The Banana Pudding shake I chose was AMAZING! I would swear someone stole my personal banana pudding recipe! The bits of gramcracker that snuck into my straw upon each slurp were appreciated. Did I say TWENTY-SIX flavors???? WoW. And although the ice-cream is not made on site, that does not negate the phenomenal creamy texture & delicious flavors. Feel free to taste test. 

Owner Judy recommends the Cuban Sandwich while her high school-aged son Christopher prefers the Cheesesteak. I opted for a Tuna Melt, & was impressed that the tuna salad is made to order; I could have had more or less onion & celery (or none). The delicious pressed bread that sandwiched my tuna salad was made at a Tampa bakery. I love that it's another local business! 

BREAKFAST is served ALL DAY; there are 17 offerings! And there are 5 Kids' Meals available. Family meals, not on the menu, are also available for purchase & will cost you $30+. Phone for more info. There's a wall sign that lists the daily specials. 

The only thing I didn't find here that would have been the cherry atop the ice-cream sundae of life (so to speak) was a dill pickle spear. I would have loved to have been served one w/ my sandwich & chips. 

The shoppe, w/ its bright blue walls & corner ice-cream cone, is down-to-earth adorable & clean. The walls are H*a*P*p*Y; customers can even use a colored pin to mark their hometowns on the USA cork map. A child's birthday party here will cost you $10 a head-- see pic w/ details. 

I walked in a stranger w/ a camera & an appetite. I emerged on a high from the wonderful conversation. I returned home to eat a GREAT sandwich & to delight in a FANTASTIC milkshake (not that I partook of the latter on my drive home, of course:) 

Will DEFINITELY return when I'm in town for Crews Lake Wilderness Park & am hankering for a quick & tasty meal served w/ a side of small town hospitality. Kudos to Judy & Christopher!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1cf54dc13e8c0e1d50""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Food, Restaurants, Hot Dogs, Sandwiches, Breakfast & Brunch, Burgers, Cheesesteaks"",""business_id"":""pKWCgqQkKpumlgmbSLYX6Q"",""name"":""Moody Judy?�s""}]"

They were very nice to still be serving even though the whole market was about to close.

Really quickly I just ordered the corned beef on rye with Russian dressing.  I just found the meat to be so incredibly tender and flavorful.

What a cute restaurant!  Cuter than puppies???... mmmm.... maaaybe?  Cuter than Emma Stone or Ryan Gosling?.... DEFINITELY.  Cuter than your bf/gf?... no (okay, sshhhhh... {yes}).  It's THAT cute.  It's actually a restaurant on top of a bakery/dessert shop.  Girly as hell, but hey, if my girl's happy I'm happy.

I think we came here our last day.  Just needed something to eat, but omfg we were not expecting something so gorgeous as we got to sit on the balcony overlooking the streets of the old French Quarters.  And let me tell you, my gf's all about those cute European-ish countryside lit-by-sunrise romantic open-air eateries.  This was perfect.

Even better, I think we had the whole restaurant to ourselves!  It was just us, looking down at the beautiful world, enjoying the sunshine bathing each other's happy faces.  Attended to by a beautiful and very nice waitress.  We couldn't have stumbled upon a better spot...

...oh, and btw the food was amazing too...

1. Sucre Special Blend $3

2. Orange Juice $4

3. Caprese Sandwich $12 ""heirloom tomatoes, fresh basil, burrata, sun-dried tomato pesto, baguette"":  Delicious!  Perfectly toasted, with the greatest application of burrata cheese I've yet seen on bread.  The sauce added just the right amount of extra flavor.  It was so simple, and so divine.  If you don't know, I'm really picky about sandwiches.  Hell, I don't think I've ever given a perfect score for a sandwich until now... 10/10

4. Roasted Cauliflower Wedge $14 ""fried shallots, sambal cream, feta"":  I think this one blew her mind.  It's a New Orleans thing I guess, cause we saw this at some other restaurants too, but this one was prepared so exquisitely.  There was this yummy pink (of course) spicy yogurt sauce on top.  Plenty of texture too, with a char that almost reminds me of BBQ.  So yummy I forgot it's vegetarian.  10/10

5. Sucre Dessert $7.50 Apple Pomme?:  Unfortunately I forgot what this one was called, but my notes say ""apple pomme"", but I'm not sure if that's right because it would be redundant.  Anyway,... it was frickin' amazing!  I loved the slight alcoholic bite soaking the cake.  The cheescake texture was so light, which paired perfectly with the sweet apple pie topping.  Everything was so harmonious, including even the white chocolate!  You know how on many desserts people just love throwing on white or dark chocolate just to make it prettier, but it tastes so pointless that you just throw it to the side?  Well, here I really encourage you to take a nibble of the white chocolate with your bites--everything comes together so well.  10/10

I HIGHLY recommend you come here for brunch.  It's so divine.

me1EibSL-SisPSPGq2u1lg,PHSda9zEwtFicCICD6TP1A,5,102,"Luna Grill has finally made it's way to the 805 and I'm so glad we have a new Mediterranean option since Santa Barbara lacks this type of food. I first tried Luna Grill in Oxnard at the Collection and my taste buds were immediately turned on. They serve up fresh salads and flavorful meat dishes such as the chicken and ground sirloin. The chicken is nicely grilled and very moist with a hint of lemon flavor to it. The ground sirloin is just as flavorful and very different from what I've ever tried. 

Customer service was great here on my visit and oops my bad I didn't get the name of the gal that kept coming around to check on our table but she did a wonderful job! All of the staff quickly greeted us and made us feel welcomed. Even though it was the first day I still received the same treatment at the other location which says a lot about their customer service. Great job guys!

This restaurant is a fast food type place so you order at the register and find your own seating. The wait time was reasonable with the food being served looking freshly prepared yet still maintaining a nice presentation. Not your typical fast food restaurant so you can expect fresh healthy ingredients versus greasy fried food. 

My co-worker ordered the Mediterranean Chicken salad and let me sample it. This is definitely something I plan on ordering next time I return. The chicken was served on top of Israeli couscous with ingredients such as tomato, mint, cucumber, parsley, feta cheese and other ingredients I can't remember but the feta cheese was delicious! It sure didn't taste like store bought but more like the real deal feta.

There are plenty of options and combinations on the menu that you can customize to suit your taste buds. They also offer vegetarian and vegan choices. 

The regular hummus is my fave served with pita bread. I've tried the spicy one before and I didn't really care for it. This shareable item is plenty for 2-3 people depending on your appetite.

Pro Tip - Save your receipt! This will be something you need if you are interested in downloading the App and earning points. I downloaded the App because I plan on being a regular here and instantly earned a free shareable valued at $5 plus an additional 13 points in celebration of their 13th Birthday bringing my points to 32 after I scanned my receipt. After you reach 100 you receive $5, not bad!

SN0_nZiwe89XGuM7NXhRog,F9gyc-k7IPwJ_qkOcwJyIw,5,51,"With 4.5 stars on Yelp & open 22 years, I just had to come check this Port Richey traditional eatery out myself! I was NOT disappointed! 

I asked lovely Tina (who's been employed here 5 yrs) what she recommended. Without hesitation, she recommended the burgers. And I'm glad she did! My hamburger (minus the bun) & fries (a small upcharge) were both WONDERFUL! Normally, chips accompany the burgers. 

The thick, flavorful burger reminded me of the ones my dad would make us on special occasions. (My parents were very frugal.) I am a fry snob, & it's a rarity that I eat (& love) French fries. These were perfection-- a light crisp on the outside, a very small amount of grease, & a soft, pillow-like interior. Yummy! They were even good cold hours later. 

During the pandemic, this eatery is offering family meals To Go; phone in to request information. I arrived at breakfast time, but I was told I could order lunch if I wished. 

The menu is EXTENSIVE. Offered on the four pages are: 18 Specialty Platters, 14 Sides, 9 Egg Breakfasts, 3 Breakfast Platters, 17 Omelettes, 14+ Pancakes, 6 Breakfast Sandwichs, a Breakfast Wrap & a Breakfast Burrito, 3 Eggs Benedict, 12 Breakfast A La Carte items, 9 Burgers, 19 Sandwiches, 9 Lunch Wraps, 8 Salads, 6 Beef Lunches, 11 Poultry & Seafood Lunches, standard beverages, plus beer & wine. (I'm quite sure I've omitted a few items:) 

Pam is the owner & self-trained chef, a perfectionist by nature. Her son, Dimos, could not have been friendlier. (He tossed in a Yelp discount w/o me requesting it.) A second son does not work in the business, but both men are graduates of St. Leo University. Pam & Dimos could not have been more personable-- see pic.

Over the next year I came here a few times and it was not all that memorable, as I recall. Fast forward to Dec. 2018. I popped in here for a late lunch. We were promptly greeted, offered drinks and chips/salsa followed. The salsa was fantastic. The best salsa I can ever remember having out. The chips were fresh, crispy and were salted perfectly. Guacamole was spot on terrific. Wanting an enchilada, my server suggested the shredded chicken. She said it was more flavorful. I took her advise. They were delicious. The best I've ever had. They had a nice kick to them, however not to hot for those not looking for the heat. My son was ever so pleased with his quesadillas. 

We have a Mexican restaurant on every corner,  with more and more popping up. I struggle finding one that I think is worthy of even returning. The search is over. This placed nailed it for me.

This restaurant was a class act from start to finish. While visiting St. Petersburg my friend and I spoke to several locals who all recommended it. We were looking for something really nice since it was Valentines Day. Then while riding the downtown looper another rider again recommend Gratzzi and the trolley dropped us off right off at the front door. 

When we arrived we were asked if we had a reservation. We had only made up on our minds on the spot so of course we didn't. I was instantly disappointed because I figured there was no way they would fit us in on Valentines Day but seconds  later they said we will find you a table. They could not have been kinder or more welcoming. 

I started off with a glass of house wine while looking over the menu. They brought us some delicious complimentary bread to start with which we dipped in quality olive and balsamic vinegar. My friend and I decided to share a Cesar salad and the Biancaneve pizza which is a white pizza with herbed ricotta, spinach, bacon, chicken, basil and mozzarella. 

Both dishes were phenomenal and I could have stopped there because the portions were large and filling but the real reason I wanted to come here was because they make the pasta in the cheese wheel which is something I have always wanted to try. On the menu it is called the Cavatellii Bada Bing ($29). The  cavatelli pasta is flambéyed inside a Parmesan cheese wheel.with prosciutto, basil, and vodka. It is more than a meal, it is a show. It is prepared next to your table as they explain what they are doing. Everyone watches because it is so dramatic. The pasta was the richest cheesiest pasta I have ever eaten. A half portion was plenty. 

The service and food are top notch here. It was Valentines Day and you could have easily turned us away but instead I will remember this as one of the highlights of my trip to St .Petersburg. The night was really special. Thank you for making us feel so welcomed.

MRxO6BZDJhAKBufFh5HIrQ,apmw_lkLdwWbeYiI9ysdJg,5,51,"We came here for dinner last night and was able to find a table immediately.  It wasn't very busy because they had just opened.  My daughter has eaten here many times so I had a pretty good idea what I wanted based on her recommendations.  We started with the ""rosemary garlic fries"" (delightful), the ""charred Brussel sprouts with pine nuts"" were not overly charred and the crunch from the pine nuts added extra flavor, the ""pork belly pops"" were amazing I could have eaten a platter of them.

For my drinks I tried the ""Island Time"" a rum blended with more rum that tasted wonderful and the Manhattan.  The main course items were all equally delicious: the ""grilled cheese with pancetta"" bread was toasted with Parmesan cheese and it was delicious.  The ""wagyu sliders"" were the best I have tasted in a while.  The sliders were juicy and seasoned nicely.  

Our waitress was super friendly and kind.  The windows in the restaurant are so large you are able to view the city from any angle while enjoying you meal.  I would love to go back and try more of the menu items.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c18f54dc13e8c0ddf68""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Bars, Gastropubs, American (Traditional), Cocktail Bars, Nightlife, Tapas/Small Plates, American (New)"",""business_id"":""apmw_lkLdwWbeYiI9ysdJg"",""name"":""Bar 29""}]"

It's been awhile since I've been here but I'm glad to see the happy hour is back! Beginning at 5pm to 7pm you can grab yourself a drink from the HH menu, ranging from $7 and up. They also have their regular drink menu and also serve a few food dishes. I will try and get that menu pic next time! 

My latest obsession here is the spicy margarita! There are no artificial flavors in this drink and I especially love how it is topped off with a lemony, lavender and slightly salty foam. It's not made with egg whites either. The bartender shared his secret to the foam, but I honestly can't remember how they did it lol. My bad! But you just need to come here and try it for yourself. 

This place is Cajè coffee during the day and by sunset it turns into a speak easy. Pre-Covid the front doors were closed and you had to venture around the back to get in. Now the front doors are open and there is a sturdy parklet stationed out on the curb with outside seating. Inside seating is also available and the vibe is a nice throw back in time. Also, a little dark and romantic for those who wish to have some privacy. 

Overall a great place for coffee or great libations! The staff here is very welcoming and friendly.

bZW7S8B71ZY9v8OQwkthLg,q36uZc2hQml10YGHazJaoQ,5,68,"Secret Bao is a relatively recently opened restaurant that one should not miss. Upon entering the restaurant, signs direct dine-in & pickup/delivery customers to the appropriate station, thus moving the customer flow efficiently. After placing one's order, a number is given to display on the table. Staff bring plates, utensils and napkins prior to receiving the order.

The indoor spacious dining area is well-lit with lots of natural light. The area was immaculate and tables were being serviced and sanitized as customers departed. There is patio dining for enjoying the beautiful Santa Barbara climate, as well as being located across the street from the Santa Barbara County Courthouse Sunken Garden, which is another great place to enjoy their fare.

Staff circulates around the dining areas to handle customer's needs, and to deliver orders. I would like to give a shout-out to ""Celine"", as she was very attentive and seemed to motivate her fellow workers.

Their signature offerings are a mind-blowing selection of modern Asian cuisine with fusion selections of baos, as well as ""Not Baos"". Currently, their specialty baos include Smoked Salmon, Fried Shrimp, Maitake Mushroom, Korean Fried Chicken, Pork Belly, among others.

A sampling of ""Not Baos"" include, but not limited to, Local Halibut Ceviche, Oyakodon, Tuna Poke, Bibimbap, Japchae, and more. The menu is still evolving, but one can't miss with the soft & fluffy bao buns and their delicious fillings, as well as their rice & noodle dishes.

They have an interesting beer, wine & specialty drink selections, such as Miso Michelada, Miso Bloody Mary, Sparkling Sake Mimosa. On tap, they currently offer Draughtsman Rice Lager, 3rd Window Nelson Saison & Boochcraft Kombucha. There are wine selections as well available by the glass, half-bottle and bottle.

PLvBnPRptIRNEPlTUHQWnw,I5jxUHS1Dp2rg40eDzyiCA,5,62,"Hands down the BEST Indian food I've eaten from Tampa to Lake City. A good friend had told me I needed to patronize this restaurant. She said it was frequented by Indians & that she & her husband had never had a bad meal here. They both raved about the naan & all the varieties offered! 

Upon arrival, we decided to each order naan & share four different entrees. We ordered the Garlic, Cheese, Keema, & Kashmiri naan. (Keema is stuffed w/ mince & spiced lamb while Kashmiri is stuffed w/ nuts, raisin & coconut.) ALL were PHENOMENAL-- easily the BEST naan I've ever enjoyed. The latter two were my personal favorites; the Keema offered delicate flavors that melded perfectly while the Kashmari could be called a delicious sweet bread. As a fan of Garlic naan, the naan here BURST w/ flavor. With all the varieties, the texture & consistency of the naan coupled w/ the fabulous flavors make ordering different varieties to share paramount. (I've been told the Onion naan is excellent as well.)

Along w/ the naan, the CHILI SHRIMP appetizer @ $12 was a SHOWSTOPPER-- see pic! I will definitely order it upon our next venture here. And the Samosa was excellent; it had the most flakey outer shell of any Samosa I've eaten. (& I order the appetizer @ each & every Indian restaurant.) 

Our entrees (paired w/ white rice) were perfect-- see pic. The Goat Bhuna ($18), Lamb Saag ($18), Shrimp Vindlo ($20), & Chicken Xacuti ($16) were DELICIOUS! Soooooo good! Even though the more expensive Shrimp Vindlo was very good, the three of us each picked one of the others as a favorite.

This restaurant in Ybor (close to two large paid parking lots) offers a large, outside uncovered patio w/ a beautiful fountain & up close view of the trolley, the Ybor roosters, two sections of an esthetically pleasing dining area, a daily lunch buffet (pre Covid), one large wall TV, & EXCELLENT SERVICE. 

The MENU is extensive-- many dishes offered here that I've never seen on menus from other Indian restaurants. (These's a menu section of vegetarian offerings as well-- see pic.)

I am SO happy my three friends (who are regulars here) finally decided it was time again for Indian food. For me, Rasoi Indian Cuisine is hands down the BEST Indian restaurant in the area! I'm already excited to return!

NOTE: Unless yuu get lucky enough to locate a parallel parking spot on the street, you'll need to pay to park. AVOID the 717 PARKING lot close by. I learned too late that parking is $10-- the near-empty lot should have been my clue. Just one block further away is the City parking lot; it will cost you approximately $1.50 per hour.

UpgHDFBdprsgy31jYKfGUA,E0E901zeU9Kir_MqeYx-5w,5,75,"Arriving at 3:30, I learned Ban Bamboo closed for two hours on Saturday afternoon and reopened at 4. So, I had a little time to wander along Ridge Avenue and take in the beautiful Spring day and the local color. The street scene was active with outdoor seating at the brewery and many open doors allowing the kitchen aromas to waft out to we pedestrians. Definitely created the aura of being a neighborhood. 

When BB's ""Open"" sign lit, I went in to discover a small dining area with lovely Buddha shrine front and center, and heavy southeast Asian decor all around. A cafe in Vientiane or Pattaya would look as good. I ordered Tom Kha Soup (veggie), Beef Satay, Red Curry (veggie), Drunken Noodles (chicken), and Kai Soi (beef), to go. It was 40 minutes to readiness, so I continued my exploration of the area while waiting, and thought about what I remembered about Lao and Thai cuisine. 

While both are very regionalized so that there are many distinctions even in different parts of each country. Still, there are a few generalities that hold true. Where Thai uses coconut milk in many dishes making it sweet, often counterbalanced by the heat of chili peppers and bitterness of lemongrass; Lao kitchens lack coconuts, and use more lime and fermented fish sauces for flavor. Lao is a lot saltier than Thai. 

So, it was easy to know which was which in my package. The Tom Kha Soup came on strong on sweetness from its coconut milk/galangal base, followed immediately by a lemongrass bite. It could have used more variety of veggies in the bowl, but the taste profile set off a riot in my mouth. The Red Curry was similar in sweetness, but lit a fire from the chili paste used to turn the color crimson. The veggies were still semi firm, adding to the texture, along with the bell pepper, bamboo shoots and Thai basil. The Beef Satay was lean meat with excellent BBQ type sauce, and on the sweeter side. Drunken Noodles were definitely from Thailand in flavor and plenty spicy from roasted chili sauce. Kai Soi, on the other hand, was more a hybrid, using thin sliced beef in a coconut milk broth, mixed with egg noodles, red onion, cabbage and lemon/lime juices. It reminded of Indian curry with its sweet/sour profile. 

Although travel time neutralized the higher taste amplitudes to reduce the delicate intricacies that exited the kitchen, it was still a wonderfully entertaining meal that is well worth revisiting, along with this Ridge Avenue neighborhood.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c18f54dc13e8c0ddf42""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Laotian, Thai"",""business_id"":""E0E901zeU9Kir_MqeYx-5w"",""name"":""Ban Bamboo""}]"
0X6qeNLrlpFu06cbd5rsRA,DwSoW3CcQZuzxYi-wOxYTw,5,80,"During a recent trip to St. Petersburg my friend really wanted to visit this bakery. As soon as you mention cupcakes I'm all in.

The name of the shop is a play on the French word soirée meaning an evening party or gathering. Swah-rey was created by owners Leslie and Gregg Ciccone who noted the lack of dessert bars in the St. Petersburg area. They wanted to pair scratch made desserts with wine, craft beers, hard ciders, and coffee.They opened their first location in 2015 in the Grand Central District and a second location also on Central Avenue in downtown St. Petersburg in 2017. 

 Although they also sell cake truffles, dessert bars, creme brûlée', cream pies, marshmallows, and other assorted desserts they are most well known for their mini cupcakes which are baked in 13 flavors daily. You can order a hook up which is your choice of a mini cupcake and a mini beverage, either alcoholic or non alcoholic. 

I love that when I walked in I could clearly see that they love dogs as much as I do. They are helping to raise money for Southeastern Guide Dogs and you can purchase a treat for your dog called a pup mini. They decor is super cute with pink and turquoise pastels. I ordered a coconut mini cupcake and a special flavor they had for Valentines Day, chocolate covered strawberry. After I paid they handed me a free sample of their strawberry marshmallows. They were so delicious I had to have a container. This was a delicious stop on my recent trip to St. Petersburg. If you want to have your sweet tooth satisfied have a soirée in your mouth at Swah-rey.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1ef54dc13e8c0e32a8""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Food, Wine Bars, Coffee & Tea, Desserts, Bars, Nightlife, Cupcakes, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Restaurants, Cafes, Bakeries"",""business_id"":""DwSoW3CcQZuzxYi-wOxYTw"",""name"":""swah-rey""}]"

In my honest opinion the lobster rolls here are the best in town! There's no competition compared to this one. 

I'm glad the location is shared with the Shaker Mill and Modern Times. It gives you a chance to grab a cocktail or beer from either place. There's plenty of seating inside and outdoors.

oESxNruT3tU9tmH9ZBhZ_A,PoaNRg8e1QpLehz4Cocebw,5,75,"First experience at Bottle Cap and I can assure you that it will not be our last! 

Bottle Cap is a small but mighty local neighborhood eatery and sports bar that has been sitting in the heart of 12 South since fall of 2020! Per staff, they celebrated their 1st birthday in mid-November 2021! Before we get too far, I want to expound on ""small""...it isn't small in the coffee shop or food stall kind of way, but it is smaller than your average sports bar, and while it isn't the largest in size it is laid out well with all the space being used expertly to ensure as many folks as possible can enjoy this spot on those busy game days! 

Bottle Cap is essentially just one big dining room with a good sized bar on one end and garage doors that open to 12th Avenue on the other...and in between those two things you have a healthy mix of booths and high-tops, neon signs, cartoon caricature portraits, Route 66 style artwork, sports memorabilia and 14 TV's! The TV to table ratio is here is the best I have ever seen as there are only about 22 tables in the place and again, 14 TV's! This makes this spot the perfect sports bar as there is no way you will miss the game you are after! 

Food wise they serve up a lot of sports bar classics from sandwiches, burgers, wraps, wings, nachos and salads. In addition though, you will also find things like chicken and waffles, cheesesteak and one of my favorites, loaded fries! They also have a small brunch menu on Friday - Sunday from 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM - you will find waffles, pancakes, burritos, omelets and even steak and eggs on this menu! 

We decided on some good ole fried food to help us deal with the cold and rainy day! I opted for the Buffalo Chicken Loaded Fries and my partner got the (3) Tenders tossed in Lemon Pepper sided with fries. The Buffalo Chicken Fries were simple and perfect! The fries and chicken were fried perfectly and crispy, the blue cheese dressing and crumbles were perfectly portioned and scattered as to not overwhelm the dish and the buffalo sauce coated everything wonderfully! Keeping this same energy, the tenders were absolute perfection! First off, they were the LARGEST tenders I have ever seen. They were meaty, crispy and coated expertly in that delicious lemon pepper seasoning/sauce! 

They offer a full bar with all the staples of a good bar with a decent selection of beers, wine and spirits. They did work hard on the signature cocktail list as it features 10+ house drinks and they even have a few house shots if you are in the mood to really party...or celebrate your teams victory or ease their loss! 

Service was phenomenal from entry to exit. The host was super welcoming and got us sat immediately. He also made sure to wish us a good day on our way out. Our server was excellent, as she was friendly, efficient, attentive and helpful! 

There is not much outdoor space, but on those good weather days you can sit on the entry patio which has a few bar stools or right out front where they have a couple of picnic tables that sit directly on 12 South. 

Only things that were a miss for us was the parking and single use bathrooms. I get space is of the essence, but for a busy sports bar, single stall/use restrooms is a killer. There was someone waiting for the restroom at every moment of our visit. And I understand parking is limited in the 12 South area, but that doesn't mean I am not annoyed by it! lol Luckily, the experience and food made us forget about these two little things! 

Overall, Bottle Cap is a cool spot that I can definitely see being a solid neighborhood bar for locals near and far! We may not be living in the 12 South area, but this place is certainly going to be on heavy rotation for us!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e2d6a""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Bars, American (Traditional), Breakfast & Brunch, Nightlife, Restaurants, Pubs"",""business_id"":""PoaNRg8e1QpLehz4Cocebw"",""name"":""Bottle Cap""}]"

Needless to say I snagged a window seat for people watching purposes. My server was just as pleasant as my escort and extremely accommodating; as I am notorious for altering menus to fit my specific desires. She didn't flinch a bit and kept a smile. 

I ordered the Oyster Benedict without the hollandaise or English Muffin and added a pancake. The oysters were TO DIE FOR!!! Lightly battered and seasoned to perfection. The pancake was decent, nothing to rave about. I'd definitely recommend Stanley as a great way to start your day.

81Bp1iPKoryt4ZXcUtC7wg,mc9V_wG4QyRYew9_S8R44A,5,83,"I was fortunate to visit Eddie V's twice in late July, once with 3 wacky friends & then via invitation. I had no idea what to expect upon my first visit, although it was suggested I not wear my usual flip flops & hoodie:) 

Not open for lunch, definitely make a dinner reservation days prior to your prospective visit. Upon arrival, I learned quickly that parking is not visible from the front (although it's in walking distance), but free vallet service is front & center. Everyone, from hostesses to waiters (dressed in all black) to vallet staff, was VERY friendly. Most patrons were dressed in business casual or in semi formal fashion. (I was surprised to see so few decked out in more formal attire.)  

Due to one in our party being a wine salesman, we brought our own bottle; Eddie V's corking charge was $25. There was unintrusive mandated social distancing; per Tampa mandate, the restaurant was limited to 50% capacity, & almost unnoticeable plexiglass had been installed to separate each booth. 

The menu was not lengthy, but each & every food I tasted was mouth-watering. Sampling different foods w/ a group of friends, I reluctantly shared my  WONDERFUL $38 5-piece jumbo shrimp entree w/ jumbo lump crab & garlic:) Our Truffled Macaroni & Cheese, w/ its slightly crunchy outer shell, was INCREDIBLE-- by far the BEST mac & cheese I've EVER tasted...just UNbelievable! My friends enjoyed two different steaks (both great, especially the bone-in one in truffle oil) as well as the Chilean Sea Bass w/ light soy broth-- also delicious. The least expensive (& smallest) steak on the menu was $42, I believe.

On my second visit, we went all out. At $16, The Heirloom Tomato Salad (a Caprese salad w/ Italian Burrata) was spectacular-- it contained the freshest-tasting cheese I've EVER eaten. The crap-stuffed shrimp appetizer (2 pieces for $18) & the warm bread brought to every table shouldn't be skipped. My $36 Mustard & Wry Whiskey Glazed Salmon w/ baby yellow carrots & spinach was a worthy contender. My companion's medium rare 12 oz Filet Mignon ($50) was PERFECTION. I tasted the steak; it seemed to melt on my tongue. Our Sautéed Spinach side w/ parmesean cheese @ $12 was phenomenal (too good not to order on both visits), & our $19 Lobster Mashed Potatoes were very good (& definitely interesting); it contained pieces of claw meat, & was covered in a special gravy. Sides here are large to very large; each will feed two or more diners. We happily split a $14 flaming Bananas Foster Butter Cake that was too rich to finish--- but Oooh, sooooo good! Our most charming waiter Stephen G (w/ his Ghanaian accent that I spotted almost immediately) topped off a superb dining experience. Thank you, Stephen! 

With no alcoholic beverages, our bill for two was $179 before adding the waiter & vallet tips. At $220+, it definitely was NOT an inexpensive culinary experience, but I recommend Eddie V's if money is not an issue. (And highly recommend you order the Truffle Mac & Cheese.) I won't be returning anytime soon on my teacher's salary, but I'll jump at the chance to return to try another menu item if the bill is covered:) 

Competitor Berns is great, & perhaps a little less expensive than Eddie V's because salad & a veggie accompany each entree, unlike @ Eddie V's. But I prefer Eddie V's because the dining experience is more CASUAL, although it sadly does not offer the cool & very tacky round, red crushed velvet bathrooms that Berns harbors:)","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e2db8""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Jazz & Blues, Nightlife, Bars, Arts & Entertainment, Lounges, Restaurants, Seafood, Steakhouses"",""business_id"":""mc9V_wG4QyRYew9_S8R44A"",""name"":""Eddie V's Prime Seafood""}]"

K8SBkH_MoKEtLPpz6LhDcA,epk5jqy6do2Uq8mmnJ4H7Q,5,51,"COVID-19 TAKEOUT REVIEW

These are the times that try our souls.

To grab a break from constant at home dining, at least two or three times a week we pick up takeout meals from either a place we haven't tried before, but has been bookmarked for a long time, or an old reliable that for some inexplicable reason had dropped out of the rotation. So it was with Primo Hoagies in the Glen Roc Center near Trenton-Mercer Airport in Ewing, NJ.
Nothing like a premium submarine sandwich on a fresh sesame seeded torpedo roll to pleasure and comfort a weary heart. And, Primo, the former Italian deli out of Philly that is now an expansive regional franchise, knows how to bring that iconic satisfying experience home. 

We ordered over the phone for curbside pickup and sent the 19 year old who is spending the rest of his college freshman year at home out to secure it. Ordering a Turkey Schwartzie (sliced roast turkey, Swiss, lettuce, tomato, sweet pepper relish and mayo),  Corned Beef Schwartzie, and traditional Roast Beef & Provo Hoagalone, at $10 per, we actually had enough for two meals after cutting them into quarters and mix/match sharing. Our separately purchased bag of uber crisp & spicy Herr's Jalapeno Potato Chips were the perfect counterpoint to the soft semi sweetness of the sandwiches. 

And, an outstanding mention is demanded for the wonderful bread encapsulating the quality ingredients. Those babies were so delicious with sesame seeds generously spread atop each creation that I could easily have been happy with just them and a shmear of butter. So good!

I'm not sure how you've managed to elude me for so long, but better late than never!

This hidden gem was such a pleasant surprise!  When you first walk in you'll find that it's not big by any means, but it's quaint, cozy and charming and I think that's what makes it so special...not to mention that it's family owned and operated...nothing better than a mom-and-pop restaurant!

Once you're seated and have a chance to really look around, you can't but help admire the various works of art from local artists adorning the walls. There was an unframed penciled sketch of a woman that hung along a curtain rod that particularly piqued my interest (by the way, some are for sale).  I absolutely loved the groupings of mason jar pendants that hung from the ceiling!  They cast a warm industrial flare to the overall décor along with the oil-rubbed bronze ceiling fans.  As far as seating goes, they offer both table and booth seating.

OK, so on to the food!  I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Salad and my friends ordered the Crab Cake Sandwich and the Powerhouse Salad.  Let me just say...other than all of us absolutely loving our lunch choices...the presentation was beyond!  It's my understanding that the owner, Jeff Stewart, is the Executive Chef and it's obvious he's got mad culinary talent!

So looking forward to coming back again for dinner and the buzz is they have an amazing brunch!  Btw, just a friendly tip...it's BYOB so be sure to come prepared!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1ef54dc13e8c0e3070""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Steakhouses, Vegetarian, Tacos, Seafood, Mexican, Vegan, American (New), Restaurants"",""business_id"":""Dh65GRW4FmOEjDv_UuPP4A"",""name"":""Kitchen 519""}]"
oXfHBQZ8q4fr9qHh604VPg,5HJz1MV553ZKslOwxUKrDA,5,52,"MyThai Kitchen recently opened on Brownsville Road, Trevose, PA. It is in an old tiny strip with a narrow parking field right in front. Easy enough to get in, but a bit challenging when departing. Don't let that deter you, because once inside you enter a simple dining room with about a half dozen wood topped tables, and honest to goodness Thai dishes prepared with love and attention by folks who came naturally by their skills - they lived them from birth. No Thai pretenders here.

I was there for a late lunch, arriving just short of 3:00 to an empty house. I was greeted warmly by two women, one the chef and the other working the front room. They thanked me for coming, directed me to a table in the front corner and handed me their small double sided menu. I was in time for the lunch special. I ordered a small bowl of tom yum soup, drunken noodles with beef and an iced tea. I asked them to bring the heat. 

The soup was strongly spiced with lemongrass and loaded with veggies, including fresh mushrooms. The first spoonful took my breath away, but I adjusted to the spicy boil and enjoyed it the rest of the way. I asked for high flames and that was what I got. I was pleased they did not make any ""cultural adjustment"" for a presumed western pallette. The noodles were broad and mixed with peppers and other multicolored vegetables. Thin slices of grilled beef finished the plate, along with an excellent opulent brown sauce. Loved all of it. The 10% grand opening discount was another nice touch (without asking).

Service was attentive and attractive from the orange apron woman. She stopped by often to see how I was doing and to answer my questions. On my way out I asked to take a photo to memorialize my visit. My wish was granted. 

Take a look and tell me you wouldn't return as soon as possible for more authentic Thai cuisine!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1cf54dc13e8c0e19d7""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Thai, Asian Fusion, Noodles, Restaurants"",""business_id"":""5HJz1MV553ZKslOwxUKrDA"",""name"":""MyThai Kitchen""}]"

Keep your eyes open for this place as it can easily be missed. There are two locations in the French Quarter; this one is a stand alone (that has a larger selection and the roasted cauliflower sandwich) and the original is inside a bar. This establishment as a whole has vegan friendly options. It has a small space with a few tables and chairs. They have a restroom for customers. Friendly vibes. I love their spin on this traditional meal--amazing po boy sandwiches here.

I came for a spot of lunch. This place was one of the very few restaurants in downtown NOLA to offer a vegan version. I seen on the menu that they offer a roasted cauliflower po boy and that is exactly what I ordered. All the ingredients included Roasted Cauliflower, Pickled Radish, Dried Kale, Avocado, Romesco Sauce. You can imagine my excitement when my food arrived. I could not wait to make it disappear.

The sandwich was flavorful as everything infused nicely. The sauce was light and I could taste it throughout with every bite. Did I mention, they offer amazing sandwiches?? I would gladly return as I have my eyes on the Roasted sweet potato po boy with spiced Roasted Sweet Potato, Braised Collard Greens, Black Eyed Pea and Pecan Spread--this po bo is offered at either location, however the location inside Erin rose might be temporary closed currently due to Pandemic.

FAi7a9lw0NVeJj3GZ4PxOQ,16tjKOvMw_nOgNViq2LwOQ,5,73,"This has GOT TO BE the best fried chicken EVA!  I'm so glad I had a chance to see what Nashville Hot Chicken is all about.* The order took about 10 minutes mainly due to freshly frying a new batch.  This batch came out glistening with fresh oils on its surface which gives the skin a crispy, spicy and slightly sweet crunch. The inner white meat, as you break open and pull it apart, starts to ooze out its juices followed by the hot steam escaping into the air.  If you desire REAL fried chicken, be ready for a fattening experience that'll overwhelm your taste buds.

The sides equally played their part.  Collard greens is a side item that epitomizes the Southern  comfort food, perfectly done.  Pimento mac and cheese surprised me with the correct consistency of the cheese and I never would have thought of this match, just as a sandwich spread.

Finish yourself off with a happy ending, with dessert that is.  Dive into the melt-in-yo-mouth peach cobbler and do NOT forget the ice cream on top.  O M G, look at those fotos, Becky!

Five stars.  Head there during off peak times to avoid extremely long lines.

With a background in Business Admin, & w/ her daughter by her side, Jane decided to become a chocolatier. 

The chocolates are made on site. They contain no additives or preservatives. (The Ganaches should be eaten within 3 days-- all others within 3 months.) The chocolates will freeze well if first wrapped in foil. 

This is my second visit to this business-- my first since this chocolate factory sold. The quality, quantity, variety, & taste remain the same-- VERY IMPRESSIVE. The prices are higher now, but that may be due to the toll Covid (& Covid restrictions) placed on businesses. 

The interior is still clean & attractive-- see pics. Service today was professional & VERY friendly. This is one of only a few chocolatiers who offer an impressive line of Sugar-free milk & dark chocolates. I could have saved money by opting for a pre-packaged pound; however, I opted to personalize. My pound totaled $36.75. Expensive, yes, but absolutely DIVINE!

Available are special occassion chocolate gift sets; naughty chocolate designs (you'll have to request to see those:); chocolate gift boxes to hold chocolates; chocolate-covered apples; white chocolate; & chocolate cigars-- to name a few. I also noticed coffee & two chocolate bakery items. There are approximately 70 different small chocolate varieties made here, along w/ 11 Sugar-free offerings-- definitely plenty to please everyone. 

Sign up to earn Schakolad bucks w/ every purchase. Once you've earned 500, you'll receive $5 off your next purchase. Schakolad is a Corporate Gift Specialist.

This business has two outside metal tables w/ chairs just outside the front floor. Paid parking spots line the front & side of the building.

It is a tight squeeze going through the front door and passing along the counter, but I found a spinner right there, and had the exalted pleasure of watching the action of the cooks, assistants and servers, as they danced around each other taking care of the hot steel grill and the crush of phone take out orders, while always finding time to chat with those around them with a quip and a smile. 

This is definitely a greasy spoon dive, but in the best way possible. If you are entertained by fast hands and flying knives and spatulas, then there is no better theater in the City of Brotherly Love than a orchestra seat in the Clown House. You watch the action up close and personal, as take out orders are written directly on the white bags that will contain the food once cooked. No need for an order pad. And, if close enough to the grill, the occasional spattering of oil or home fries, or spitting bacon, will reach out to touch you gently, and remind you that there is no extra charge for the grease stains on your clothes. That iron is so full of food waiting to be off loaded onto plates or takeout boxes, that its amazing that the kitchen hasn't caught fire in the 66 years it has been slinging hash to the appreciative masses who have been scarfing their incredibly tasty dishes all this time. 

 ""Delicious,"" is the right word for the food produced here. That grill is so well seasoned from decades of eggs, meats, potatoes, peppers and cooking oil, that it might be edible. The prices are cheap enough to be downright ridiculous. My sausage, egg and cheese sandwich on Kaiser roll, with a side of excellent home fries topped with sautéed onions and green peppers, all the hot java I could drink, came to less than $7. 

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

So, I had an incredible breakfast, a month's worth of local color, and full bore entertainment from the totally engaging staff, non-stop for the half hour or so I was indulging myself. Although a rookie, I felt at home and one of the regulars. I really didn't want to leave, but I finished eating, and the next customer was waiting to take my stool.

To say the least, Nomzilla was super ""Nommy"" and an absolute pleasant surprise!

In all its essence, Nomzilla is a sushi and Asian fusion restaurant that serves a variety of dishes from common Asian dishes such as fried rice, bulgogi, curry, ramen, udon and of course, sushi. Additionally, you can get things like bao buns, brussels and wings. On all areas of the menu you can get vegan and veggie options as well. And of course you can wash all this stuff down with a craft cocktail or beer. The menu is decently hefty with options, so you could visit many times and definitely never get the same thing, but I would imagine after visiting this spot a few times you would have a favorite or seven.

I rolled in with a few friends after sushi and cocktails. They have around 30 different rolls to choose from in addition to sashimi and hosomaki options. I went classic and specialty for my rolls with Spicy Tuna and Baker Twins. The ST is your standard roll, the Baker Twins was a house roll and twist on shrimp tempura with the addition of cream cheese, cucumber, crab meat, spicy mayo and eel sauce. No lie, may be my new favorite roll, not only for the taste but the price, as it was $11 and the spicy tuna was only $6!

Drink wise, they have a well equipped and stocked bar with spirits, a great list of house cocktails and a small list of select beers. I ended up with a gin gimlet, which I did not know I wanted or was in need of! It was $9 and worth every penny.

Service was the only thing that was off here. The place was not busy and there were several servers running around, but in general it was slow. Given the current state of things, I give service a pass for the most part. While it was delayed and slow here, all the fellas were super nice and helpful when they did stop by the table.

Overall, Nomzilla is a solid place and one that may just become a regular reason I hit up East Nashville more frequently in the future!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e2bd1""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Salad, Japanese, Bars, Asian Fusion, Sushi Bars, Vegan, Restaurants, Cocktail Bars, Nightlife"",""business_id"":""FnEWE7CdxTolKWEgVKAlsg"",""name"":""Nomzilla!

How do I know this is a supermax experience? 

Because I find myself thinking about their excellent bagels even when I don't plan to be there that day, and excited when I know it is my destination. These babies have addicted me. They are my opioids. 

The shop is still in the same location, and too small for tables and chairs. Yet, the master baker and his crew have perfected the onion bagel I prefer - firm skin, soft airy interior, and ample roasted onion flakes all around. When fresh from their ovens, they are plenty good enough to eat just as they come from the bin. If you time your visit just right, you can get them still warm from baking; nothing short of a completely memorable experience. Yet, even on the normal day when they have cooled and wait for your order in their bins, like puppies in the window of a pet store, they are simply a joy to consume with a heavy smear of favorite cream cheese (veggie, please!). 

I stopped in today for my weekly fix, and picked up a bag full for the family this weekend. I figured it's time to share the bagel bounty with those I love. 

They do muffins and breakfast sandwiches, too. They look zoftig, but I am more the purest, preferring my bagels the traditional way.

cMoBwuYf73e8LQDjyUpcSw,EagkHaaC-kUozD3MPzbRIw,5,171,"Vegan Gumbo? Yes, please!

I was seated at a table with fresh cut flowers right next to a window that looked onto Chartres street; I could also see parts of Saint Louis Cathedral and Jackson square. A lovely rose scent traveled through the air in slow motion and I got a whiff, from time to time, from the flowers that were on my table (a centerpiece for all the tables), which was nice. I took a peek at their menu ahead of time so I knew that they served vegan gumbo and that was top on my list of things to try. I came here for a spot of lunch.

Louisianians seem to love their gumbo; gumbo is a strongly-flavored stock, hearty, warming, and rich. In this instance it was vegetable stock and also meat-free. It usually comes in a bowl as it is quite similar to soup and typically always served over rice. From what I gathered it is a tradition staple in regards to traditional food and It fits right in with the melting-pot nature of Louisiana cooking. I have tried gumbo many years ago. This is merely a prelude to my take on vegan gumbo. 

My food arrived shortly after ordering and I had to let it cool for a moment as it was piping hot. Water was my beverage of choice. Once the gumbo cooled down a bit I took a spoonful and it was delicious. The flavors were impeccable and I appreciated their spin with vegan gumbo; keep in mind it is a little thicker than regular soups. It had fresh seasonal veggies, scallions and all on a bed of traditional steamed rice. It warmed me up so nicely on a chilly day and a perfect dish for gumbo adventures.

Friendly vibes and good service.

s_T1UC5ae3VpvD_52CIG0A,jmG_QxXXfz2cnw9dQCXJLQ,5,196,"A delightful bakery that I stumbled across while taking my mom to breakfast next door at Metro Diner.

NOT SO BRIEF BACKSTORY - My mom and siblings are creatures of habit. They will go to the same place repeatedly without any curiosity or interest in trying other restaurants or shops. They also don't generally venture outside of their neighborhood. I can't tell you how many times I would come for a visit armed with a place I wanted to try and they would say ""that's too far"", even though in many cases it was less than 10 miles. I've always been different from my family in this way.

So I began to leave them behind about 8 years ago and ventured out into the wild unknown with just my wife and kids. Well, they slowly started to change their attitudes about this after a few years and now are far more food adventurous than they've ever been in the past. As a matter of fact, I've created a monster in my oldest sister. She goes out of her way to research new places to eat, especially when planning a vacation. 

My mother on the other hand, is still not very food adventurous. She insists on always going to breakfast at Village Inn and NEVER remembers how many countless times we've been before. ""Momma, I can't take any more of the Village Inn! Let me take you someplace new"" I begged. It took some convincing, and I honestly almost gave up because of her complaining... but she finally gave in. 

Along the way she told me how she was once more adventurous in her eating and misses a bakery she loved as a child. She went on to describe some sort of apple dessert she referred to as 'apple slices', but went on to say she hasn't seen them in many decades.

-----

Well, as we pulled up to Metro Diner, she noticed La Segunda Bakery and asked if we could check it out after our meal. I suggested we go first and before long we were drooling over the offerings in the neat and well stocked display case. My food sensory glands locked onto a delightful tray of strawberry cheesecake cupcakes when suddenly I hear ""Oh my God, they have them, they have them!!!""

Have you ever seen the movie Ratatouille and witness the moment Anton Ego take a bite of a dish that instantly takes him back in time? Well, I watched first hand as my mother turned into a 70+ year old child before my very eyes. Her excitement for La Segunda's Apple Squares was seriously more entertaining than a toddlers first Christmas. She was so pumped up that suddenly she had to have all of her favorites and wanted German Chocolate Cake as well as a few other desserts.

""Slow your roll, momma!"" I warned as her eyes were desiring more than her body could handle. ""You're right son"" she said as I paid for just the apple slices. But in a sneak move she signaled the staff to box a slice of German Chocolate Cake when I wasn't looking. Then had the nerve to smile devilishly as I finally noticed her signing a receipt.

She sampled a taste of each during breakfast and danced in her seat with delight, excited to bring them home for consumption later. She enjoyed the experience of the bakery and her meal @ Metro Diner so much that she said on the ride home after breakfast: ""I need to get out more. I wonder if your sisters know about this place.""


[ FINAL THOUGHTS ]

I'm truly happy to have found this bakery AND to have shared the experience with my mother. It was a pleasure to see my mom get so overjoyed in rediscovering a memory from her childhood. I wonder how many memories La Segunda is making for their clientele and how many countless people will have the same sort of fondness for their products. Fondness that lasts long into the future, when todays eats are locked into tomorrow's memory as the standard in which all else is judged.

Located in the heart of Philly's Chinatown, my family would frequent the city whenever we get a chance. Even though there are many dining options, we would always choose to eat here. The owner has greeted us with open arms from our very first visit. She would come by our table to chat with us often. They know us so well that even one of the waitresses memorized exactly what we always order. 

There is only two noodles that I love in the entire world. My mom's Dan Dan noodles and Rangoon's Festival Fish Noodle Soup. It is unlike anything I've ever had. I could seriously go into the kitchen and eat the entire pot.

I particularly did NOT remember any exceptional restaurants, so I asked around among my Yelp friends for recommendations.  It turned out that Sidney S., that Legendarily tireless Yelper who loves awesome hiking venues and fine red wines, has visited SB almost as many times as I've been to Paxti's.  I hit him up for some advice and he lead off with: 

""Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
 For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
 And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.""

When I convinced him I didn't need cash, he then proceeded to share several spot-on recommendations.  The first of these was what also turned out to be the best restaurant I visited in Santa Barbara this trip - Jane.

My Compadres and I drove into town on the first day, settled into our hotel, and then set out for what we hoped would be an exceptional dinner to commemorate the start of our Santa Barbara trip.  Jane turned out to be a really cozy, romantic little place on State Street, which Sidney had described as slightly upscale while still being casual and friendly - that's exactly what it was!  When we arrived we were seated at a table in front of the fireplace (not burning that evening, but still cheery).  The ambiance at this place is amazingly romantic; it's not only an exceptionally pleasant place to share a meal with friends, it would also be an excellent place for a date with that special someone...

The service at Jane is darn close to perfect; attentive without being overpowering; you feel very taken care of, but they're not intrusive.  Corkage is $20; I brought along a bottle of 2006 Turnbull Cabernet that evening, along with my trusty traveling aerator. 

The first of the culinary highlights of our meal was the Firestone Red (Onion) Rings & Spice Herb Cream.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jane-santa-barbara?select=8v7o_vu_-Vz8gNXCN-rt2g#8v7o_vu_-Vz8gNXCN-rt2g  Deliciously spicy, the batter was crunchy, hot, and wonderful!  The second was a small mountain of crispy and addictive fries disguised as a side that came with one of my Compadres' burger.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jane-santa-barbara?select=aSvJmNV1nKI3XehQgfr_xQ#aSvJmNV1nKI3XehQgfr_xQ The third were some surprising tasty vegetables!  These last I'm proud to say I ate, but am embarrassed to note that I wasn't sure what they were at first, and I had to ask - they were Broccolini (a green vegetable similar to broccoli; it's a hybrid of broccoli and kai-lan, Chinese broccoli).

Our entrees were all excellent!  I had the grilled Filet Mignon served with a deliciously savory Oyster Mushroom & Herb Cream sauce.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jane-santa-barbara?select=JbpR2rSNM80qwNfSIvyinQ#JbpR2rSNM80qwNfSIvyinQ It was tender, well season, and perfectly cooked to the medium I had requested.  One of my Compadres had the Classic Cheese Burger (Provolone, Tomato, Lettuce, Red Onion, Dijon & Mayonnaise) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jane-santa-barbara?select=avDtVqUK-1AcO5HokHCT4w#avDtVqUK-1AcO5HokHCT4w and my Pasta-crazed Compadre had (wait for it...)

JXgjHXS3jrGgM81UdBWC2A,VVH6k9-ycttH3TV_lk5WfQ,5,62,"It's been said that pictures say a thousand words, but my pictures don't come close to doing the food at Willie Mae's justice. 

FOODIE ALERT!!!
If you are planning a trip to New Orleans, you've not been here before, or you've tried Willie Maes, and it's been a minute, this is a must try. 

This is where the most amazing fried chicken can be found. If you are on a diet, want to be on a diet, you really need to pretend that this is part of your daily diet food LOL

First off, they do not take reservations. They are open most days, but I would strongly encourage you to call the day before you plan on going there just to make sure that they plan on being open. The hours posted are not always accurate.

Go hungry. You will want all of the food. 

Second off, be prepared to stand in line to get inside. It's not uncommon for smaller groups that may even be behind you in line to be seated before you if you happen to be part of a larger party. Relax, you will get there too.  When you do, you'll be met with incredibly friendly and expedient service, a clean table, and eventually the most amazing fried chicken you may ever have.

The fried chicken plates come with two choices-you may either order dark meat, or white meat, but no combinations. Ever. The white meat plate is one chicken breast that is so huge, I'm wondering where they grow these chickens. The plate also includes two large chicken wings, and a choice of one of the sides. All plates include peas. When was the last time you saw peas served on anyone's plate?! I have to say the peas were downright delicious. The dark meat plate, is one extremely large chicken thigh, one chicken leg, and a wing. You also were given a choice of one of the sides as well.

We ordered one dark meat, and one white meat plate. We also added on two of their corn muffins, and an order of their butter beans. I know, most people are ready to enjoy the red beans and rice, but I'm here to tell you go for the butter beans. They were the best damn beans I've ever had! The corn muffins weren't bad but nothing special.

The chicken. Omg the chicken. It's perfectly seasoned, with the perfect crunch, that makes me finally understand the phrase ""slap yo momma"".  The meat is juicy, and has a nice kick to it. You won't be able to get enough.  The portions are huge! We both had ordered the Mac n Cheese as our "" side"", And it was pretty tasty and cheesy. Have I mentioned that the chicken was freakin delicious ?!? 

Butter beans, where have you been my entire life?!? The butter beans are served in a big open bowl, with a huge group of white rice in the middle of them. I wasn't a fan of the white rice, but those beans... OMG those beans. I love the fact that they are prepared vegetarian style.  They taste like heaven.  Seriously wear your stretchy clothes to dine here.  You'll thank me later.  

Admittedly, I lack the ability to be a part of the clean plate club, and the waitstaff was more than happy to box up my chicken, some of the beans that we had not finished, and my muffin. I had such high hopes of enjoying it later that night. I also had wanted to try one of their desserts.

I'm pretty sure that there isn't a restaurant in New Orleans that does not offer some type of bread pudding. Willie Mae's isn't the exception.  Our waiter strongly encouraged us to try their bread pudding, and I am so glad that we did. They make one of the best bread pudding's in all of New Orleans.  We only ordered one because we were so full and sharing is caring.

The bread pudding is served warmed, with a light sauce poured over it.  I could eat this for breakfast.  It's oh so good.  Don't make faces at the raisins. They add to the yumminess.  It's light, moist, and you'll want more.  

Diners tip- wear your stretchy pants, go hungry, be prepared to stand in line, and order all the food.

My husband and I were excited to see the Omakase ($75.00 per person) option on the menu. After a long day it was nice to sit back and let the Chef surprise us. I made a request that red meat not be included in our selections since we visited a steak house the day before. 

All of the 6 selections were delectable and rolled out of the kitchen beautifully timed. This really enhanced our dining experience. I recommend dinning this way at the Ocean Hai.

They have set the bar high in all areas.  Service is spectacular with knowledge of food impressive. They offer over 300 bourbons and 40 glasses of wine to choose from. They have the areas most enthusiastic cheese program with over 60 different varieties and serve charcuteries, which  feature a number of  terrines, sausages, torchons and pates. If cheese is your thing, it is best sampled by ordering the Cheese Monger Platter for $47.00, which is a chef's selection of 18 cheeses. This could easily feed 4 people, I think. It was just too much cheese for me, as I eat little dairy.  The others in my party were in heaven.

Dinner features small plates and my fave way to do this is by sharing. Highlights for me from my most recent trip are the Mojo Palm Hearts, Fried Brussels Sprouts, Brie and Mushroom Toast, Smoked Chicken Biyrani, Snapper Ceviche, Blackened Scallops and Hamachi Crudo. The menu is constantly changing. If they ever have the Roasted Cauliflower I suggest that, as it is delicious.

What lures me back time and time again is Happy Hour, which is offered Monday- Saturday 5-7. Specials on both drinks and bites change daily. Oysters are $2.00 each with other bites being offered for $6.00. Please note you must be in the bar area or outside patio to take advantage of the HH pricing. They pack a crowd so if you want a seat strive to arrive at 5.

Check out the pics for all of their options for food. Burgers, vegan food, breakfast, lunch whatever you want.. We like that the menu has something for everybody.  Luis had their Buffalo cheesesteak again and said it was good but the Buffalo sauce they use is a bit thin so it makes the roll soggy. 

We sat in the car to eat because all of the booths were taken. I really wish they had more than four booths because we'd love to sit down and eat. Mr. Lee is friendly and probably knows most of his customers.

They were very unusual and taste great. 

We shared an entree of the Southern Fried Chicken. ($18.00) It is chicken thighs marinated for 24 hours and served with red beans and rice. The red beans had chunks of andouille and ham hocks in it. All of it was seasoned perfectly and taste great. 

To finish our meal my husband decided to try the Peach Cobbler. It was easily the best dessert that we had over the entire week.

qNiCcmqsq91UVZY4hLPt4Q,RFqxRAkKIr4JhiOT-Ytp5Q,5,61,"This review is not for cooked seafood; I did not order any prepared foods. It is solely for the variety & quality of uncooked seafood; prices; service by the local owner; & the cleanliness of the establishment.

This is a charming & clean (albeit rather small) six-year-old seafood restaurant and market owned by a lovely woman whose boyfriend owns ""The Fish Guy"" seafood restaurant & market in New Port Richey. (Her son owns a wholesale seafood company in Cedar Key.) City Girl Seafood holds just two round tables for dining in. 

I came just for the market. Prices were quite good. This is what is REGULARLY AVAILABLE inside the five large floor freezers, & the price per pound, etc:

Grouper (market price/$17.99 today), Red Snapper ($13.99), Swordfish ($15.99), Sockeye Salmon ($13.99), Salmon ($12.99), Sushi Grade Tuna ($14.99), Mahi Mahi ($14.99), Cod Loins ($9.99), Haddock ($10.99), Basa/Swai ($8.99), Flounder ($9.99), Sea Scallops U-10 ($18.99), Alligator ($14.99), Lobster Tails (market price/$29.99 today), Snow Crab Legs ($13.99), Soft Shell Crabs ($52.99 & $17.99), Lump Meat Crab Cakes ($10.99 & $7.99), Argentine Shrimp ($14.99 & $12.99), White Shrimp ($13.99 & $11.99), Craw Fish ($17.99 for 3 lbs), Frog Legs ($9.99), & Octopus ($9.99)

Available CLAMS (not frozen, of course): Littlenecks (100 @ $24.99), Middlenecks (100 @ $29.99), Topnecks (100 @ $35.99), Farm Cherrys (100 @ $34.99) & Wild Cherrys (100 @ $38.99).

ALSO AVAILABLE TODAY: Gulf Shrimp @ $15.99 lb, Jumbo Gulf Shrimp @ $16.99 lb ($22.99 lb elsewhere!), Key West Shrimp @ $19.99 lb, Dungeness Crab @ $16.99 lb, King Crab @ $27.99 lb,  Grouper Heads & Cheeks @ $4.99 lb, Whole Mullet @ $4.99 lb, Snapper Heads @ $2.99 lb, Cobia @ $9.99 lb, & King Fish Steaks @ $8.99 lb.

I happily purchased 100 Topneck Clams (which aren't found everywhere) & 2.58 lbs of Jumbo Gulf Shrimp. Both products were gorgeous & cooked up beautifully! The jumbo shrimp were de-veined perfectly! Delicious, too! I will definitely return for more, especially whenever they're needed for a gathering of friends & coworkers. (I no longer need to make the long drive to Cedar Key.)

According to the menu the owner provided me, the following prepared foods are offered: 7 fried seafood dishes w/ one or two sides, 6 fried sandwiches w/ two sides, 6 sandwiches & burgers w/ one side, 10 appetizers, soups, and salads (w/or w/o fish). 

I did not try any prepared foods, but other Yelp reviews reference it, & I found some comments noteworthy.  

There are Gift Cards for purchase; the customer selects the amount.

Open 11 AM to 9 PM Monday thru Thursday & 11 AM to 10 PM every Friday & Saturday, ""Walt"" is the owner of this downtown Safety Harbor establishment, as well as Hog Island Fish Camp & Olde Bay Cafe, both of Dunedin. Water Oak opened in Dec. 2019. 

This is the place you come for fresh, local seafood, streaks, & produce. As a diner here, you'll have the option of sitting outside @ one of the thirteen four-person tables on two separate sidewalks; sitting @ the beautiful interior bar; or relaxing inside @ one of the many tables w/ hardback chairs or thick cushions. (Frank Sinatra was serenading any outside diners on the side street. However, Jackson's Pretty Young Thing from a nearby eatery was ungratiously interrupting Frank & diners who chose to sit @ the Main St tables-- consider that should you choose to eat outside.)

Service by Bartender Taylor was SUPERB. A bubbly hostess (& the daughter of a teacher), she was filled w/ warmth & attention. From her, I learned a few of the customer favorites (although she said almost every menu offering is very good). Some recommendations: Blackened Steak Bites; Coconut Green Curry Muscles; Watermelon & Arugula Salad; Braised Beef Shoet Rips; Short Ribs Fries; Hogfish; & Grouper. 

I; however, ordered off the Specials Menu: STUFFED GROUPER topped w/ crawfish & jumbo lump Blue Crab jambalaya mix topped w/ an Andouille Creole sauce w/ a sides of fried grits & vegetables. I substituted the rice for the grit cake-- excellent choice on my part. At $32, my ENTREE WAS DEVINE--  SEE THE PICS! I especially enjoyed the perfectly cooked & perfectly seasoned local veggies. My entree was so flavorful & aestetically beautiful that I already have plans to return here w/ two separate sets of friends! I want to try more!

L*00*K @ the Saturday & Sunday Brunch menu pic! Unbelievable choices! From 11 AM to 2 PM, patrons can order off the Brunch menu OR the regular menu. Some potential choices of mine: Shrimp & Grits; Crab Cake Eggs Benedict; Fried Hogfish & Parmesean Grits; Mushroom, Arugula, & Goat Cheese Fritatta; & Bottomless Mimosas @ $15.50. 

Happy Hour is Monday thru Friday from 3 PM to 6 PM. See the menu pic for $3 & $4 food specials, as well as $4 to $6 drink specials-- draft beer; Red & White House wines; Red & White Sangria; House Margarita; Mini 1792 Old Fashion; & Single Well Liquor w/ Single Mixer. 

Every Wednesday, get 1/2 off a bottle of wine while enjoying live jazz from 6 PM to 9 PM. 

This truly is the place to eat, as well as drink! There are 13 Beers on Tap & at least 30 Wines, as well as 30 varieties of ""Sips.""

Evening & weekend RESERVATIONS ARE RECOMMENDED.

I've been introduced to the cuisine in the 80s and from one Viet. restaurant to another, the menu items seem to be the same. Nothing was exciting to me anymore. When I travel overseas or out West, the menu choices are more vast.

Finally, a Vietnamese restaurant that excites my tastebuds. It's exotic, fresh and the dishes are done to perfection. The portions are generous as well.

Here is what we ordered:
- Imperial rolls (OMG, I could keep eating these)
- Grilled Pork Patties w/Vermicelli (so delish)
- Saigon Beef Pho w/flank, shank & eye round 
- Pork Belly Rice Bowl w/Bok Choy (so tender)

You know that common orange fish sauce (Nuoc Cham) served in all Viet. restaurants? Here, it is different. I couldn't get enough of it. You can tell that they make it themselves with a tantalizing twist to it. Their Pho broth is different from most, it's nice to taste something new. This is definitely my new favorite Vietnamese restaurant. 

Service was outstanding. Our waitress, Katie, was super friendly and so is the rest of the staff. Due to COVID-19, it is outdoor dining only.

sjAWRjiroQSOnmcMWSzV9Q,2MWEEuY3dtD2DNP99sNe_A,5,122,"If you like Salvadorian food then you must check out Elubia's Kitchen! The food here is not only authentic but everything is gluten-free and wheat free. That doesn't mean the flavor is lacking so don't let that stop you from trying it out. Trust me you would never know the difference! 

I found out Elubia is allergic to gluten and wheat hence the reason for excluding it. I find when I eat foods without gluten I don't get bloated or feel blah afterwards so I'm not one to back away from gluten-free anything.

As for the food me and my co-worker went halfers to share one of their Grande Meal specials for only $19.99. This came with 3 pupusas of your choice, 5 potato taquitos, rice and beans, curtido aka cabbage slaw, and tomato salsa. More than enough food for us to share, and we even had leftovers. 

What blew my mind about the potato taquitos is that they were still crispy! Mind you this is after picking them up, driving back to work, and 15-20 minutes later eating them. I was shook! Never had taquitos remain that crisp after traveling lol. 

My favorite Pupusas were the Revueltas which is a mix of chicharrón (pork rind) beans and cheese. The other was the Diablita which consisted of chorizo, jalapeños, habaneros, and cheese. Luckily mine wasn't too spicy, but there were a few bites that had a kick! 

The curtido was fresh and a nice topping for the Pupusas. The tomato salsa is more like a soup, and it reminded me of the broth from Mexican rice. An interesting side item but it was delicious. 

The salvadorian rice and beans were excellent! It was nice to try something that didn't taste like your average rice and beans.  These had a unique flavor unlike anything I've tried. 

Ordering online was easy, and they have curbside pickup. You can also walk up or have it delivered. 

They are only open 3 days out of the week (Wed, Thurs, Fri) 10:30am-1:30pm and 4pm-7pm.

Right now they are donating a portion of their sales to our local Food Bank which is much needed! I'm glad I could contribute in some way, and I will definitely be back to continue my support.

Be careful of the breakfast cocktails they offer at super reasonable prices! I ordered a screwdriver once, (yes it was breakfast but it was my day off so whatever lol) and I assumed it would not be that strong because of how inexpensive it was.

H03NuJm9tc8GC21EL21Wdw,kw3uLKXAhRGha64MBKiMTg,5,58,"FIVE STARS for DELICIOUS VEGETARIAN Indian food when I am a lover of meat in my Indian cuisine. This family owned restaurant had the misfortune of opening just two weeks prior-- during a pandemic. The quality & taste of the food alone earns it five stars! 

The lovely owner, Anil Dubey, could not have been more gracious. He came to my table as I waited & answered all my questions (after his high-school aged son & wife took my order). 

This vegetarian restaurant has two chefs, at least one of them cooked here prior when this restaurant was Tabla Indian Cuisine. 

On the Take Out menu alone, there are 10 Appetizers, 6 Soups, 10 Chaats, 6 Indo-Chinese foods, 22 Curries, 18 Dosas, 13 Breads (including 4 Naans), 9 varieties of rice, 6 Atithi Specials (including North Indian & South Indian Thali), 4 sides, 11 beverages, & 6 Children's entrees @ $5.99 - $6.99.

I was immediately asked how I wanted my food prepared regarding spices, & for once I've found a chef who knows how to please a ""mild"" palate. The samosas are delicious. The garlic Naan is my favorite thus far (& I've tried plenty), the rice is moist, & the Paneer Butter Masala is flavorful & ever so creamy. (I did not miss the chicken.) TRULY EXCELLENT INDIAN!

The dining room is large and clean. There's a buffet that will be available twice daily once life returns to normal (post Covid). This restaurant is open seven days weekly from 11 AM - 3 PM & 5 PM to 10 PM. 

PLEASE help these local owners get off the ground running w/ their excellent vegetarian cuisine! Eat in, take out, or phone for delivery. You won't be disappointed!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0df99b""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Indian, Restaurants, Noodles, Soup, Vegetarian"",""business_id"":""kw3uLKXAhRGha64MBKiMTg"",""name"":""Atithi""}]"

Serving breakfast, lunch and dinner they manage to fine tune every last detail. Oh I enjoy their HH too ! Daytime offerings are served with one placing an order at the counter where you may visually see many of their offerings. You pay, find a seat and they will bring your meal to you.  Don't let the long lines at this hour deter you. They move quickly.  I'll mention,  you may sneak into the bar at lunchtime and receive full service. Dinner turns into a sit down more formal sophisticated , yet casual affair . It does get loud here,  without a doubt.  Not a place for a book club meeting, which I found out first hand. 

All food is prepared in-house with the freshest of ingredients. Their artisan bakery is sinfully delicious. For lunch I find myself ordering the acorn squash stuffed with the chicken salad of the day. It hits the spot. They offer hefty salads for about $8.50 with the addition of chicken or salmon for $4.75. All sandwiches may be turned into a salad. The last time I had dinner I split the watermelon salad, lump crab cakes and grilled octopus (on special) with a friend. It was all truly divine,  involving all of your senses !

I can't even describe the flavor besides it taste like....tahini lol. And some peanut butter and maybe.
I also tried their falafel and dip which was equally as impressive. The falafel was super crispy on the outside while moist and bursting with flavor on the inside.

h0rz71l0frwvwvQ3QIslRw,Am5wWa0v13NZRsJ-g9f9cQ,5,52,"Chestnut Hill Brewing Company had the foresight to be the anchor tenant in the Market at the Fareway on Germantown Avenue in the heart of Chestnut Hill. Already one of the most picturesque communities in greater Philadelphia, it has made itself a premier destination with the opening of the Market with the nano-brewery within. Now, it is possible to select from a broad variety of street food alternatives also housed within this adaptive reuse of an old warehouse, but also to wash it down with a decent beverage brewed on sight. They also have a pizza operation right there, with a Yelp deal that draws you a free pilsner with the purchase of one of their pies. These guys do everything right. 

My choices: Korean Double Fried Chicken Wings from Chicko Tako and Pumpkin Ale from CHBC. Doesn't get much better than this! 

The ale was rich with a nutmeg/allspice accent in a beautiful dark red amber liquid. Easy drinking, and a perfect washdown for the delicious wings with their crispy exterior under a thick gloopy sweet and spicy sauce. Cut through that like a hot knife through cool butter. 
The brew tanks were visible to all, and the folks working the taps seemed to thoroughly enjoy their craft. At $6.50 a pint, it was hard to find anything to complain about. Even found a seat at a community table to enjoy my snack. 

Kudos to Chestnut Hill Brewery for seeing the possibilities of producing and selling suds in this small market, and extra credit for the town council and mayor for letting it all happen to the betterment of the community. 
The creative energy here was palpable and greatly appreciated.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e2695""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Food, Beer Bar, Breweries, Nightlife, Pizza, Restaurants, Bars"",""business_id"":""Am5wWa0v13NZRsJ-g9f9cQ"",""name"":""Chestnut Hill Brewing Company""}]"
mrAGkNFNy1dkawnHbSccHg,4WCyuH0Dc6DAD79AyC0-iw,5,136,"Cute little taco spot that serves up flavorful meats cooked over mesquite just like Jalisco! There's no other place in town that does it like this. A must try at only $2 for a nice packed Al Carbon taco! 

They take Cash only! So bring that green.  

They are only serving tacos right now but next week they hope to open up the menu to serve everything else. This place and concept reminds me of when Lilly's tacos first started with a simple menu and small location. I can see this place doing just as good in the long run.

The location is a little hard to find if you're not familiar with the area. They share the space with Lily's flowers. If you know where The Habit is on Milpas it's located across the street in the small plaza. They have a few signs outside so look for those! 

As of right now hours are from 6pm-12am and they're not open everyday due to catering events. I noticed they do seem to be open on taco Tuesday though.

Ruben took my order and was very welcoming. They just opened on 4th of July and are still trying to get situated. 

The tacos were delicious! Very well seasoned and the meat had a nice smokey flavor from the wood. I'm glad to see a new up and coming taco spot that's bringing us something different. Well done guys!

BFCoPRxWZyqFn2S_lZicwg,Fzrpwup-gVia-806_ozFkQ,5,58,"Facts: Years ago, this is where I finally tried sushi for the first time. Turns out I love it, and have eaten sushi from many different places since, but this is still my favorite place for sushi. I make sure to eat here every time I am back in Reno. 

I've yet to find a place that can beat or even match their all you can eat sushi ($15 for lunch) and I'm always happy with the food. It's always fresh and well prepared.

I like to try something new each time I am here but as of now my favorites that I always get are their California Rolls and the DX Roll. I know California Rolls are too simple for some people so if I could only recommend one thing to try, it would be the DX Roll.

We always sit at the ""bar"" for all you can eat and the service has always been pleasant. Over the years I've seen different sushi chefs but all have been great and I've never had any complaints.

Never eaten anything here other than sushi but they do have a full menu of Chinese food and lots of tables and seating for that.

Since I'm so happy with this place I've never found a reason to try out other sushi places in the area, but I can't find a single reason to NOT recommend this place.

pgoY7wKWxkfY1ZBrWx04OA,k7ESc-3Odp6t9-V17YDipA,5,51,"This tavern is 7,500 square feet of excellence w/ regard to culinary creations, service, & aestetics! Only the second Chuck Lager America's Tavern in the U.S., due to Covid & Covid restrictions this dream became a 1.5 year expedition. 

Once the Wiregrass Mall space was renovated, the workings of the restaurant took shape under managers Tim & Sergio (the latter a former self-trained chef), both sent from Philadelphia to get Chuck Lager on its feet & soaring. Chef Cynthia, hailing from New Jersey, joined the team. 

The menu is the brainchild of Fabio Viviani, who created the original menu for the Delaware location. (Viviani competed on ""Top Chef,"" a culinary competition that began in 2006 on the Bravo network.) The menu consists of comfort foods from many genres-- fish, chicken, steak, tacos, nachos, veggies, fries, pastas, burgers, salads, flatbreads, 4 desserts, etc. There is something for every hungry member of the dining party, including beers, wines, & cocktails! And, BOY, IS THE FOOD GOOD! 

We ordered two appetizers, a handheld, a burger, a pasta entree, & a side-- just wanted to really sample what we had heard so much about! Everything was DELICIOUS. Unlike traditional American dishes, each recipe is tweaked to capitalize on freshness, flavors, & textures. It's those unique added touches that titillate the palate & the olfactory senses-- making for a VERY happy dining experience. The recommended Sweet Thai Chili House Smoked Wings ($12) were perfectly seasoned & cooked to just the right amount of crispness-- EXCELLENT! The pork belly-topped Deviled Eggs ($10) that both managers recommended were DIVINE. The Chicken Parmesean over noodles ($19) was a large serving & the best my companion had ever eaten; & the Smoked Brisket Grilled Cheese @ $12 (To Go) was LOVED by its recipient. My Aztec Burger w/ guacamole & bacon ($16) was recommended by superior server Karri; it was VERY GOOD, as were the Sweet Potato Fries for an upcharge of $1. Even the Cesar side salad ($7) was an original-- the sundried tomatoes made it a standout in color & taste-- see pic. Foods we didn't try, but that were highly recommended by management, were the Tuna Poke Nachos, the Steak Fritas, the Italian Steak, Chuck's Citrus Salmon, & probably a few others I've sadly forgotten. But we shall not fret for we SHALL return to try them all! YES, THAT'S HOW GOOD THE FOOD WAS! I'm already salivating for the Ahi nachos! Lol. (Returned two nights later. Unfortunately not a big fan of the Grouper Tacos @ $14. Not much grouper & not much flavor pizazz-- rather uneventful, unfortunately.)

10 cocktails; 10 bottles/cans; 7 wines (red/white); 7 House Barrell wines; 16 craft beers; 4 domestic beers; 4 imported beers; 6 Flights; & 24 Bourbons & Whiskeys (2 oz pour) round out the alcoholic beverage offerings. 

The restaurant appears to be divided into two main dining sections w/ a central bar area. There are also 10-12 wall TVs for your sporting entertainment. There's a second bar behind glass that leads to the larger covered patio on the Eastside. And there's an additional covered patio on the Southside where you'll find the main entrance. Both are complete w/ stylish bronze metal tables & chairs-- see pic.

Everyone we encountered here today was very friendly, & they appeared genuine. Our server was very personable, professional, attentive, & knowledgeable of the menu. The kitchen staff moved quickly. This establishment is very busy later in the evenings, w/ reservations for Friday & Saturday evenings strongly recommended. (Go online to reserve your nightly table from 6 PM until close; no reservations are taken prior to 6 PM.)

RINR_VrTWIYhruwyU5CcmA,g2nccd2Lc37gBAC0mFStFw,5,69,"Village Pantry Deli sits on Bridgetown Pike, Trevose, PA., in the 1960s era commercial zone. It is a true mom & pop operation that specializes in fat hoagies and deli specials of the Eastern European variety. Prices are ridiculously low for 2021. So, if you're hungry and desiring a traditional stuffed sandwich, this is your huckleberry. 

I stopped in and walked to the back of the shop where a large refrigerated display case was full of smoke meats and tubes of salami, bologna, ham and trays of homemade salads and cultural delicacies like pierogi and stuffed cabbage. I ordered a chicken salad sub, with lettuce, tomato and hot peppers on a long roll, and watched as it was made, wrapped and bagged. With Snapple and Herr's Jalapeno Chips, the cost was under $10. That was a deal and a half, and I didn't have to pay for the ton of old world atmosphere that came with.  

As I waited, I looked around at all the accessories available. Awesome pound cakes, cookies, Cento pickles and sours, and a wall of cold drinks. Service was friendly, even for this stranger, and there were enough old-time regulars to make this place a hot stove center for local gossip. Very cool.

These neighborhood haunts remind of what America used to be when the first generations settled in and started life in the New World. Now, nearly a century later, they have generally aged well, although it has a hardscrabble feel to them with narrow streets, limited parking, and undersized stores and homes that are lovely, but feel somewhat dated. 

Lucky for me, I love this sort of thing. It provides a getaway from the continual hassles of modern life and Covid anxiety.

I brought my mom here for Mother's Day and my cousin also joined us. They had never dined here before and left very full and satisfied. Especially after the bottomless cups of coffee. The coffee is strong but good! 

I ordered the breakfast sandwich, which comes on sourdough, eggs, cheese, bacon and tomato. It also includes a side of rosemary seasoned potatoes. The sandwich was simple yet it was super delicious! The bread was buttery soft, toasty and the sandwich was like a grilled cheese but with eggs and bacon inside (sans tomatoes). I loved it! 

My mom had the French toast, with eggs and sausage. She loved her breakfast and said the sausage was really good too. I wanted to sample it but we were all hangry at the time lol. 

My cousin had the Belgian waffle, eggs and sausage. She was very pleased and satisfied with her breakfast as well. 

The customer service here is excellent! Not only are they friendly but they are constantly checking on you to make sure your drinks are full and if you need anything else. They managed to bring the sunshine to our day despite the gloomy weather. Thank you guys :)

The food was to die for.. I got some sort of Chicken Calzone that had artichokes, all kinds of cheese, and fresh mushrooms.   The calzone was the biggest one I've seen.  No wonder it cost over 9 bucks.  Was worth it.  

Also ordered some Garlic bread with Cheese and Sauce.. That was yum as welll. Not too much Garlic on it.   

And the best thing was the pizza.  I tried some of my friends  ""mini pepperoni Pizza"".  It was anything from mini.. four huge slices...  The crust was thick and tasted really good.  

Im big on Pizza Crust and have to put this place up there as one of the best pizza's I've had..  If I'm ever in Reno again,.. Im definitely sliding through to this place again...","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0df783""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Pizza, Restaurants"",""business_id"":""V3gGhFQmgDZNebrC6pgHjw"",""name"":""Pirate's Pizza""}]"

We had a debate between regular and thin crust and we chose regular. It was a good decision. The crust itself had a light season-y crisp to it while the inside was soft and went well when dipped in a little ranch dressing. 
Next time in Reno, I will definitely try the thin crust just to round out my review on the place.

The chicken parmesan was a tiny bit bland but I like my food spicier than most people do, so that may not be a fair criticism. The service was just wonderful, attentive but not intrusive.   My biggest regret was that while the entrees were good, the pizzas coming out of the kitchen just made me lust for one..they looked and smelled so good..good enough that we made plans to go back next week for pizza.

The burger is seasoned with something that is so amazing that it adds flavor to the burger to make it a really fantastic burger.

""After cooked weight""
They make the burger patties larger than the actual weight so that after it's cooked you get the actual weight that you order rather than ordering for example a 1/4 burger before cooking and end up getting a smaller burger because all the fat shrink the burger.

Get the sweet potato waffle fries with the fluff it's fantastic!

The Out of this World Ahi Ceviche: What a brilliant idea to substitute shrimp with Ahi tuna and create a Ceviche Dish that is sooo amazingly delicious and unique. But to make things even more interesting, the executive chef added jicama to the equation.... 

The Clam Chowder: Delicious, clammy, creamy, thick and tasty....

The Spring Salad: Tasty salad with tons of greens, fresh strawberries and blueberries... I have to admit that I dislike goat cheese very much and I was very hesitant to taste the goat cheese that came with the salad but when I did, I could not stop eating.... The cheese was sooo creamy and tasty that did not taste anything like the goat cheese that I had thought it would taste like...

The Ahi Tuna meal was plated beautifully and the fish was super fresh.

I am a very picky diner and when I go to restaurants I have a few requests that I expect them to be filled with one time asking and God knows howmany times they just get ignored....

It's an very popular restaurant and bar with great food. I've heard great things about Lure Fish House. Originally, I was gonna eat here almost an year ago, but my plan was cut short. Had to wait 'til this visit.

Food:
I got the New England Clam Chowder soup and Lobster Ravioli for dinner. First off, Clam Chowder... Presentation was nice. It was very creamy and delightful. Heavenly good. It's my kind of soup. Excellent pick I've made. Now for the lobster ravioli. Comes with 2 pieces of bread. Really amazing. Ravioli was very good. Lobster inside the ravioli was on point. I really love the cream sauce. It's an perfect combination. It was so worth eating. 

Service:
My experience I had with the waiter was amazing. Never had any problems with the service here so far. 

Other stuff:
They do have happy hour at the certain which I didn't get an chance to look at it. It's something I would enjoy on an weekly basis. If I was living in Santa Barbara or Goleta, I would go here twice an week, just for some happy hour. But I live over 2 hours away from here. It's an no go. But will go here again, if I ever come back to SB.

Overall, excellent experience I got here. It was worth waiting for, and was my last stop before heading back home. Will be back soon.

M0nGZApv0JZxPoFhqclNLQ,44Xh-IjWDSn7XTw1hzO50g,5,54,"""He who has never done anything wrong has never done anything right.""―Amish proverb

Located in the Reading Terminal Market (RTM), the Dutch Eating Place is a true gem in a sea of amazing fare. We passed-by it several times when we first visited the market and the ""As seen on Food Network"" sign caught my eye, but I usually try not to get caught up in hype. So, we went and did our milling-about-smartly thing thru DT Philly and on the way back to the car, we decided to pop-in and see what's doing―plus I had a hankering for something sweet. 

So their Apple Dumplings ($3.25) come out in two ways: w/ whipped cream (aka boring-style) or w/ a small pitcher of heavy cream to pour on (aka get this). My girl preferred the whipped (at least she has good taste in men) but the heavy cream was absolutely delightful―but I'm getting ahead of myself.

First off the dumplings come out fresh-baked from the oven with a crust that is so deliciously crisp and buttery, and when combined with the soft, cinnamon apple interior it really made for one of the simplest and most amazing desserts I've had in awhile. Now the whipped cream was good, but the heavy cream method to me was just spectacular; yeah I'm sure the calories are increased dramatically but the rich, velvety cream when combined with the dumpling was like a pillowy-cinnamony-velvety smooth symphony in my mouth. I can't stop thinking about it.

If you come to the RTM and only have one place to eat at come and eat here. And listen to me when I say this: get two! For such a low price to flavor value you almost can't afford not to! You'll thank me later, and you're welcome.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0e03d4""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Sandwiches, Restaurants, Juice Bars & Smoothies, Food, Breakfast & Brunch"",""business_id"":""44Xh-IjWDSn7XTw1hzO50g"",""name"":""Dutch Eating Place""}]"
k9bBOm_YkYsHHOKqzMAggQ,cBiHULO8B4gTEav8eQJhuQ,5,55,"So, what's a ""flexitarian?"" 

I didn't know either until I sat at the counter in the Silver Diner, and had it explained for me in their elaborate menu. Apparently, when health consciousness is a priority, local sourcing predominates and the offerings change with the seasons, you have created a flexitarian restaurant. So, although its stainless steel & glass shell suggests a traditional Jersey diner experience awaits, in fact nothing could be further from the truth. This is a new age epicurian delight on par with the Turning Points of the world, without the pretense and only some of the accompanying cost. 

My Country Griddle breakfast (scrambled eggs, onion, green pepper, morning sausage, mushroom, potato and 2 tone melted cheddar) in a large bowl with fresh biscuit on top, was delicious and filling. The coffee was hot and strong, with a small pitcher of cold milk provided at my request (may have been from Amish cows). From my perch at the counter I could see into the kitchen where the white hats seemed to be having a good time. 

Even if you don't know anything about flexitarian kitchens, you can find your way to a very pleasurable meal @ Silver Diner. 

Nice going!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e2d7b""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Burgers, Sandwiches, Vegetarian, Diners, Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants, American (New)"",""business_id"":""cBiHULO8B4gTEav8eQJhuQ"",""name"":""Silver Diner""}]"

IFQLf1O6Jl_sq97YaoPIiQ,eEMqe1vC53vu3bkBSkekSw,5,62,"If mid 20th Century Archie & Veronica malt shops and Back to the Future big fin American road steel move your imagination, then Jem's Restaurant in East Norristown, PA, may be for you. 

What from the outside looks like another shopping center fast food luncheonette constrained by its surroundings to be a boring food dealer, is in fact a real trip down memory lane. The joint is a museum of cultural artifacts from the early days of television, with large posters of Rebel Without a Cause, James Dean, and Seven Year Itch, Marilyn Monroe. Perhaps that's why the room was full with retirees and people over the age of 70 (except for those of us needing to eat and run). This place is the original greasy spoon, for all the right reasons. 

The double ""U"" counter separated the kitchen from the dining room. My spinner faced the grill operated by two short order cooks who worked smoothly in tandem. I ordered coffee and Jem's Scramble with feta and rye toast. The full insulated carafe of java set in front of me was a nice touch. I listened to the repartee between customers and servers. It was familiar and entertaining. Most everyone seemed to be a regular. 

I noted the pile of chunk cut red bliss potatoes and metal tray of bacon on the grill. I watched eggs, pancakes, french toast and breakfast sandwiches being cooked and constructed as spatulas flew. I also saw that the grill was not scaped clean between orders, allowing residue from everything grilled there to build up and become part of the next dish. No judgement. Then, my small Scramble arrived, steaming in my face and fogging my glasses. Smelled awesome and looked like a gently beckoning glistening syren. 

It was delicious. The eggs held the sausage, onions, peppers and feta in a wet/warm embrace, allowing each forkful to hang together with all elements dancing on my tongue. There was also a hint of everything else that came before, making for a mysterious, yet very pleasant flavor. 

Maybe that is the house secret to success, or just how it accidentally became an amazing greasy spoon. Intentional or not, Jem's has a full house every morning, and is definitely doing something right.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1cf54dc13e8c0e16bd""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Breakfast & Brunch, Food, Restaurants, Burgers, American (Traditional), Coffee & Tea, Sandwiches"",""business_id"":""eEMqe1vC53vu3bkBSkekSw"",""name"":""Jem Restaurant""}]"

The food is just as amazing as I remember it to be and the presentation is just as beautiful. So glad you guys are keeping up with your unique style! Chef Ramon is a master at what he does.

All the tacos are served on a homemade corn tortilla. Not only are they delicious but they are the perfect size, thickness, and holds up very well when eating your taco. Never gets wimpy! 

Let's talk food! 

Here is what I ordered:

Chicken mole taco - The rich dark mole was slightly sweet, nutty and just a tad spicy. I added the peanuts from the salsa bar to give it that extra crunchy nutty flavor. Try it! 

Ensenada taco - Crispy beer battered cod served with cabbage, radish slices, and a mayo lime crema; which my son didn't want so it's not pictured. But he loved the fish tacos! I've had them before too and they are crunchy and yummy. 

Al Pastor taco - The meat was perfectly marinated and the pineapple pairs well giving it a nice sweet and salty taste. They don't skimp on the meat here! 

Quesadilla de Mercado - Not your average quesadilla and by far the best quesadilla I've ever had! Served on a blue corn tortilla with a nice thick slice of seared panela cheese and beautiful fresh market veggies. A true picture perfect masterpiece. The presentation was flawless! I shared half with my son and he was wowed by it too. 

Yes the food is on the pricey side but the quality, care, and effort put into making the food is well worth it to me and there is no other place in town that compares to Corazon! They truly are one of a kind and the food is made from the heart. 

I can't wait to go back and try more. Keep an eye out for the pulpo (octopus) taco when available!

Every aspect is an experience. The wait staff is ever present, and yet at the same time, you won't even know that they're there. 

The cheese charcuterie board, along with a lovely glass of wine, or a lemon drop, is a perfect way to start off your dining experience. 

You literally cannot go wrong with any of the menu choices. the seafood, the steaks, oh so delicious! There are a variety of sides to choose from, and the restaurant absolutely can meet the needs of even the most discerning pallets.

Customer service has been awesome and I would like to give a special shout out to Ray who stands out the most behind the busy bar. Not only is he a hard worker but he goes above and beyond to make sure you are well taken care of. 

Thank you Ray for being extra attentive and finding a chair for me when you really didn't have to. Now that is outstanding customer service if you ask me! 

Happy hour is fantastic! Everything on the menu is under $10. The quality of food and drinks I've tried thus far have been excellent. 

Charbroiled Oysters $9 - By far the best I've had! These are cooked to perfection in a yummy buttery garlic sauce with Parmesan cheese. 

Ahi Ceviche $8 - Huge serving, chunky, fresh, delicious, and served with thick homemade corn tortilla chips. Ask for Cholula for some heat, trust me you wont regret it! 

Crab Cakes $9 - Light, moist, flavorful and melt in your mouth. 

Baja Fish Tacos $3.50 - Crispy battered fish served in a corn tortilla with plenty of toppings. I love these! 

Wild local Halibut dinner $21.95 - Fish was light, flakey and perfectly cooked. I chose quinoa and potato cake as my side items. Both were delish.

For drinks I have to say after trying the Blood Orangecello Drop this might be my new fave. It's  not too sweet and it was made perfectly.

They had me at roasted basil blueberry margarita the first time but after my second one it was kind of weak and too fruity. If I order this again I would ask if they could make it less sweet or maybe add an extra shot.

Happy hour is M-F from 4-6pm, and Sunday from 11:30-6pm.

I dropped by the Kenner location of Cafe Du Monde for 3 reasons...
1.  It was steps away from my Kenner hotel
2.  I knew I couldn't get to the original French Quarter location until the following day
3. I needed a BEIGNET in my life urgently!

I was super excited to walk in and see the hustle & bustle going on around me.  I didnt care that the line looked a mile long. In reality there were about 15 people in front of me.  Not so bad.... i was willing to wait it out for just one bite of deliciousness. While in line i scoped out the place.  I loved seeing all the bright colored mugs for sale along with the Cafe Du Monde coffee and beignet mix. *Note to self: buy beignet mix at Original Location*.   There were tables filled with grown ups and kiddos enjoying their fresh made fluffy puffs of yumminess! Lucky for me the line sped on by and before I knew it... it was my turn!
2 orders of beignets to go and 1 order to eat immediately and a large cafe au lait.  Oohhh i couldn't wait to take a bite!
Ya'all know i don't like coffee but how could I break up a match made in heaven!

9GlJUV275mRIZs1upwihoA,FzZ2U0gLuhKVarDdXVWBQw,5,70,"Disclaimer: I usually really, really, really do not like sandwiches. The Cuban sandwich @ Marino's on Broadway is the only sandwich I've ever liked (loved, actually). So I was leery to stop in here, but I wanted to show support for a longstanding small business during such a difficult time. 

In business close to FOUR DECADES, Bearss Sandwiches first opened its doors in 1982. In 1983, Berta joined the staff, & is a staple here today. It's doubtful you'll meet a friendlier woman. She definitely brightens a room! This is a Mom & Pop sandwich shop w/ small town values & charm-- along w/ LOTS of humor. Nineteen years ago it moved to this location after selling its lot to CVS. The name remained & has been going strong ever since. While I waited, two regulars dropped in to pick up orders; everyone was on a first name basis. 

I didn't hold out much hope I'd like any sandwich from here, but BOY was I mistaken! I decided to try the Meatloaf on Cuban bread after reading the funny mention of how much Berta ""loves"" to slave over the meatloaf. I had it prepared ""all the way,"" which meant w/ mayo, mustard, onion, lettuce, cheese, & tomato. And I requested it be pressed. WOW! What a GREAT sandwich! Everything about it was fantastic, especially the Cuban bread & the meatloaf. I also ordered a side of potato salad. It was OK, but I'm not a fan of dill, & it was heavy on the dill. (My neighbor is enjoying it.) I've since been told the stuffed potatoes are exquisite! 

There's an obvious reason this 38-year-old sandwich shoppe has such excellent reviews. It's REALLY good! And a really good neighborhood staple (including Berta) is a rarity these days.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0e03be""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Sandwiches, Restaurants, Cuban, Salad, Delis"",""business_id"":""FzZ2U0gLuhKVarDdXVWBQw"",""name"":""Bearss Sandwiches""}]"

uxKwu0DaB8gIId6tJHrKtg,IKF8XeK93NsQxrXQvdGZmA,5,59,"There is little doubt that Rocco's is the best restaurant currently in Newtown. This may change as there are new kitchens opening up almost weekly in the community, but right now, this steakhouse has it going on full bore. 

I had dinner there with son and his girlfriend the other night. We sat in the glass enclosed porch that rings the first floor. The space is beautifully appointed in colonial style, and white table cloths and heavy stainless flatware. It is a pleasure to walk through the barroom and dining room to reach the porch. From that perch the Newtown bustle can be witnessed first hand. We were there to celebrate several occasions that had gone  unrecognized over the past 16 months due to Covid. We had much to be thankful for. 

Son o'mine loves his steak, and his N.Y Strip done medium was beyond excellent in texture and robust flavor. He cut me a piece knowing that this was not my normal diet, but that I was open to experiencing superior dishes. Yes, it was amazing, and it was easy to understand his attraction. I had to concentrate to appreciate everything that was going on in my mouth as I chewed and savored. His girlfriend went with a medium filet. It wasn't as juicy as the strip by observation, but she was clearly loving every bite of her medium round thick slab of beef. 

I went with the French Onion Soup and Prime Burger, knowing my diet couldn't handle a platter of solid beef. The soup qualified for possible the best of breed in a lifetime. It was rich, savory, onions, hearty beef stock, topped with french loaf under a thick layer of gruyere, seared to a near-blackened finish either in the oven or by blowtorch. The cheese had to be pierced to access the molten potage below, and to permit the superheated steam to escape. It was epic, and nearly a meal by itself.  Stupendous! 

After all this, the burger was a bit of a disappointment. True, it was a combination of ground beef, short rib and brisket, topped with onion, tomato, lettuce and melted provolone, in a brioche bun. But, flavor-wise it was a situation where more is less. I didn't get off on the mix of beef. It just didn't taste like a high end burger. I like short rib and brisket at BBQ joints, but prefer them separately, where each of their distinct attributes can be appreciated, and not muddled together. So, it was disappointing after the star quality of everything else. The fries were standard crispers. 

So, Rocco gets a less than perfect five stars here. Despite the burger, the rest of the experience was top notch, and the bar/dining area stunning In an understated way. On a less precipitous evening, eating outside would have been a legitimate option, but despite the umbrellas, we would have had to endure wet shoulders from the tropical storm brewing outside. 

No wonder Rocco's is booked solid every night. It is truly a first class night on the town.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c19f54dc13e8c0de8a9""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Steakhouses"",""business_id"":""IKF8XeK93NsQxrXQvdGZmA"",""name"":""Rocco's""}]"

CfiK7cELY36G-Pic-Xnqxg,u88VWTcy8TxuyHBv9OVazA,5,51,"Five Guys makes the best grease burgers! 

Grilled on steel that is seldom cleaned during hours of operation, the beef sizzles until well done, when it is lifted off the heat and placed on a bun already prepared with whatever accessories you want. Whatever else they do to the body, they are incredibly tasty and provide excellent lubrication to the alimentary canal. 

In addition, 5 Guys make great fries that far outclass their better known brothers. Their signature move is to toss extra fries in the brown paper bag after putting in the primary load carried in a paper cup. Excessive, but nicely so. Same goes for their shakes, which are also superior to the beef pucks. They are creamy, sweet cool ice cream splurges. Pricey, but the super caloric craving supercedes the doubtful overall nutritional value. 

So, it is an upside down meal if you think about it, but certainly a ton of fun on a bun. 

Unbeknownst to me, I had ordered online from the Five Guys on Lincoln Highway, but not the road running through Bucks County, A/K/A Route 1, but rather the one in Lancaster, PA., over 100 miles away. My bad. I wrongly assumed that their locations were in order of proximity to where I lived. Not so on their app, so the reference to Lincoln Highway led me astray. You know, I saw what I expected to see (Langhorne rather than the actual Lancaster) and impulsively jumped the gun. 

This is where Five Guys superhero Tyler stepped in to save the day. When the shop didn't have my order, he asked to see my phone and immediately knew what had happened. Not for the first time, he explained. He immediately reordered everything on the register and comped the charges, knowing I had already paid their sister store. They could correct this internally. 

Tyler's superpower - being supercool and knowing exactly what to do without making me feel like a bigger smacked ass than I already did. All this coolness made the enjoyment of my ""special meal"" almost a secondary consideration. 

Almost, but not quite, as it was digestible proof that some classy teenagers are ready to rule the world.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1bf54dc13e8c0e0f0c""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Burgers, Fast Food, Restaurants"",""business_id"":""u88VWTcy8TxuyHBv9OVazA"",""name"":""Five Guys""}]"

6r8P5rNjlqovtK1McCQGfw,AFEwa61sgl1s64MwfSaA_w,5,57,"If you enjoy classic Italian cuisine with a touch of something more modern, set in an beautifully renovated house, La Strada is calling your name. 

Its main dining room is a large round room that may have been a solarium in a past life, but has become a space large enough for a dozen or more tables amply spaced and fully windowed to permit the world outside to come in. As this is the older part of town, you can see 18rh and 19th Century buildings that remind of the pre and post revolutionary history of the area. 

The menu has all the traditional dishes, some with a special flare away from what would be expected. For example, we ordered Calamari which came drizzled with a Thai Sweet Chili Sauce and Balsamic drip. All larger rings, it was a delicious surprise treat. Our Chicken Marsala and Francais were more classical, with two large breasts each atop Penne and wonderful reductions in Marsala Wine with fresh mushrooms and lightly dredged flour coat and  Lemon White Wine base, respectively. Tender enough to be cut with our forks. 

Service was a bit slow, but not bad for a romantic Sunday night. We regretted not bringing our own bottle to this BYOB house. 

Aside - All through the meal I had the feeling that this was a Roman room in the fine tradition of Trenton's Chambersburg neighborhood, which at one time had awesome Italian kitchens on every corner. They were classy and always full with locals manging to their hearts' content. Those days have turned to Spanish/Latino pleasures, but it's great to know that that Guilded Age can still be found if we look hard enough. In fact, the owners are from Trenton, and seemed pleasantly surprised to chat briefly about the old world, where I still have an office, and loads of memories.

La Strada is of that fine school.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1cf54dc13e8c0e1a00""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Italian, Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants, Event Planning & Services, Sicilian, Caterers, Seafood, Steakhouses"",""business_id"":""AFEwa61sgl1s64MwfSaA_w"",""name"":""La Strada Italian Restaurant""}]"

I placed an order for two bags at $5 each thinking they would be in a small brown bag as I've had before; well that wasn't the case with these. They were in a much larger bag and to my surprise the portion was a lot more than I expected!

Had I known the portion served was generous I would of only ordered one bag. No complaints at all because these churros were delicious! But if you're the only one that's going to be eating them then one order will be more than enough.

The churros were still warm when they arrived and my first bite was heavenly. They were savory, crunchy but still soft inside, it wasn't overly sweet and the sugar coating was just the right amount. By no means are these churros comparable to any that are sold at a fast food restaurant! These are the real deal and once you try these you will forget about those fake churros elsewhere. 

I recommend you eat these the same day and share with friends because they do not hold up well the day after. I had plenty left over the next day and they were too mushy to eat so I had to toss them out unfortunately.

yf-Wyt5qEsMVLBOixisskQ,GBTPC53ZrG1ZBY3DT8Mbcw,5,68,"Wow!! I found myself talking about this place all day it's that good!

Stopped in for breakfast.  We received excellent service, coffee was refilled frequently, our order was taken promptly and the food was brought out in a timely manner.

The food was amazing!

Order:

Southern breakfast $15 - 2 eggs, Allan Benton's bacon, housemade andouille sausage, buttermilk biscuit, grits

Side of fruit & berries $6

French press $3.5 (Santa Lucia coffee), free refills.

The coffee tasted great.  

The fruit was fresh and cut into nice size pieces.  It included watermelon; blueberries, honeydew, strawberries, and cantaloupe

The meal was so amazing.  The bacon and the sausage smelled so wonderful, and had a Smokey taste that was out of this world.  The bacon was perfectly crispy, and the sausage was cooked perfectly as well.  It had a bit of spicy to it but was excellent.  The eggs were scrambled and fluffy.  The grits were made with mascarpone and were oh so wonderful. The biscuit was tasty and served with a side of whipped butter and strawberry preserves.

The meal was perfect, service was excellent, and we really enjoyed our visit.

I highly recommend eating here often :)

How will we Newtownians ever leave home now that these pristine creations are living among us? 

When you get to select the combination flavors you want, watch freshly baked round white cakes exit the oven and begin their short journey on the conveyor belt where multiple workers customize them as requested and then box them in attractive cardboard, you are experiencing tantalizing delayed gratification until you get to your car and can break open the box and take that orgiastic first bite. 

YEUWEEE! Instant sugar rush accented with both loud and subtle flavors. 

Strawberry Lemonade, Blueberry Bake, French Toast, Bananas Foster...you get the picture. They taste even better than your imagination. And the underlying donut cake is a strong platform; mildly vanilla light white that taste good in their own right. 

Certainly not inexpensive compared to other shops, but a perfect indulgence when you want to treat yourself well.

Open 11 AM - 10 PM Monday thru Saturday, & 11 AM till 8 PM on Sundays, live music is scheduled every Friday evening then again on Sundays mid-day. 

You can enjoy a $13 Sampler Flight; it includes 5 tasters of any draft beer. Currently, there are 17 beers on tap. There's also an online store for Brew Works merchandise (w/ merchandise also sold on site, including gift cards). Every Sunday, $1 from every pint sold is donated to a local charity or nonprofit. (The December recipient is The Nashville Food Project.)

Executive Chef Alex Liebow is responsible for the ""craft beer-inspired food menu."" Private events are held at the distillery.

The 6-beer ""Beer Burger"" was exceptional! And  the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich was also delicious, although you may want to ask for more heat if you are keen on spice. Unlike some chefs @ other eateries, our chef today was kind enough to split our entrees for us before they were brought to our table-- we appreciated it. The $12 Mint Julep was good, but costly. Our best edible, though, was the side salad-- Cesar Salad made w/ Baby Kale. Truly a PHENOMENAL tasting salad! 

Pete E was a very friendly server, & twice management took the time to stop by our table to converse. Loved the customer attention! 

This distillery offers a small first floor corner stage for live music, oak-barrel tables, two floors of dining, a front raised open patio w/ infrared heaters, a second floor open patio (roped off today), a bar on the second floor w/ an overview of the actual distillery, & a closeup of the distillery as patrons make their way to the back restrooms (where only one diner may enter & exit @ a time-- see pic). 

This aestetically pleasing establishment, w/ its excellent beers & delicious handhelds, is a great place to unwind. And the second floor dining area would be a perfect place for a birthday celebration or other type of gathering-- see pic. 

You'll find no paper menus here & even the receipts are to be scanned. Curbside pickup & no contact delivery are offered services. 

Quite impressed w/ this distillery & eatery.

With that being said, if you're lucky you'll be able to snag some free parking, but besides that, a majority of the parking is pay to park. 

But anyways, the sign's small, but noticeable enough to anyone who actually pays a bit of attention! Once I walked in, I was greeted by the cashier and offered a vanilla latte that was accidentally made, because why not? While I was sipping on the latte, I started to peer into the decadent case with numerous cupcakes available for your choosing. 

I always ask one simple question with regards to the menu in any place I visit:

""What would YOU recommend?"" 

It's a question I love, and the cashier at Bittersweet Confections immediately recommended the wedding cake cupcake. So, I got one of those, and another of the chocolate cupcake with vanilla bean icing. So let's get down to the taste test!

Wedding Cupcake:
(Visual 5/5, Flavor 4.5/5)
Edible glitter I guess it was? The entire top of the cupcake sparkled with a gorgeous appearance that proves hard to resist. The piping was similar to that of a rose on top of the base layer accompanied by silver sparkling sprinkles. The golden base retained its moisture regardless of the fact that I decided to bring home the cupcake to share with my parents. Keep in mind they live about an hour and a half away. 

The icing was delicious, and the almond flavor coupled with almond buttercream definitely enhanced the experience!

Chocolate Cupcake with Vanilla Bean Icing:
(Visual 5/5, Flavor 5/5)
If anything, my parents actually loved this flavor the most! The top of the icing was layered with what seemed to be golden edible glitter! The chocolate base was delicate, and the vanilla bean in the icing was much more evident than the almond in the wedding cake! 

One of the things that I can appreciate about a business is care, especially care with regards to their product. The consistency of both cupcakes I had were amazing, and you could tell just by looking through the clear case encasing the cupcakes that the employees also acknowledge persistency.

R2TBGyyDaCq0LwWsjiElYA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,5,142,"The best food-related thing that happened to me in 2019 was that when I tried to book dinner at Philadelphia's award-winning Zahav Restaurant, the place was unable to accommodate my request.

My dining companion, a local Philadelphian, suggested that we try Suraya, a Lebanese restaurant well-regarded by Philly's food press. Though I was skeptical of Suraya's newness and trendy popularity, I am a sucker for good Lebanese cooking, so I booked a reservation.

As a result, I enjoyed the best meal I've eaten in years. Thanks, Zahav.

[n.b. I'm about to sound ensorceled by Suraya's charms, so to maintain some credibility, here's my single complaint: Suraya's cardamom-scented kouign-amann was good, but not as good as one I had earlier that day at ICI Macarons & Cafe. That's it. That's all I've got.]

**********
Our meal began at Suraya's tidy bar, where, on the recommendation of our barman, Jesse, we ordered Old-Fashioneds made with Sazerac Rye. Mine was the smoothest and most elegant Old-Fashioned I've ever tasted. Jesse is a boss.

My buddy and I had arrived with a plan in mind. The flexibility of Suraya's tasting menu and the range of choices it offered appealed to us, and we'd already made our selections.

But then we were shown to our table, a perch set slightly above the main floor that provided a view of the open kitchen, where a wood-burning oven was cooking the dinner I didn't know I wanted.

As she took our order, our server, Nena, asked if I'd like the special: slow-roasted young goat with stewed chick peas, Swiss chard, garlic and cilantro, finished with crispy shallots, lemon yogurt and goat jus.

Are you kidding me?

Does a stranded man long for his lover's embrace? Do birds enjoy a light thermal lift as they cross the sea? And, speaking of birds, do Eagles fans revel as Tom Brady slips into aged decrepitude?

The answers, of course, are ""yes,"" ""yes,""  and ""Hell, yes!"" 

I thanked Nena and asked, ""May I please have the goat as a part of the tasting menu?"" She said, ""Sure,"" then left for the kitchen.

Soon, Nena brought our mezza, then these things happened:

- Substantial but light and slightly lemony hummus that reminded me of the hummus my Teta made by hand, fifty years ago

- Baba ganoush, whose charred eggplant was seasoned with tehina, lemon, garlic and a special treat: sweet and smokey urfa biber chili

- Muhammara, a smooth spread of roasted red pepper and pulverized walnuts blended with chili and cumin 'til it was dense and rich, like pesto, but spicier and more appetizing 

- Labneh, an Arab dairy respite from smoke and spice, a purpose served in other cuisines by lassi, tzatziki and kefir
 
- Tabouli, a usual hearty and cooling salad of parsley, cucumber, tomato, scallion and mint, made unusual by a tart drop of pomegranate molasses

Nena, a skilled and personable server, was unstoppable, as was the mezza, which also included: fried kibbeh (beef and bulgur ""dumplings"" stuffed with raisins & pine nuts); fattoush (another salad, dressed with lemon-pomegranate vinaigrette); and baskets of fresh-baked Arab bread or ""khubz"" that was just-chewy, tender and good enough to eat on its own, all night long.

**********
Here's how to eat at Suraya: bite, savor, look around, order more, take a different bite, chat, sip, then do it all again.

Dining at a Lebanese table is a creative endeavor that requires one to engage; ""What should I taste next? How would this taste if combined with that?"" We're also asked to appreciate the art on the plate; not gratuitous ""look-what-I-can-do"" decoration, but actual food, placed in such a way that the eater is enticed not to gush and take photos, but to eat.

By now, seven stellar dishes into the evening, I'd abandoned my usual pessimistic expectations. I was persuaded to trust Suraya's chef and his cooks to respectfully interpret recipes handed down by the owners' grandmother - the eponymous Suraya - and developed in consultation with her daughter, Maude.

It was clear that they weren't trying to improve (or, despicably, to ""reimagine"") Suraya's food in some Millennial way, but were instead doing as they'd been taught, then ever-so-slightly tweaking, using best-quality and authentic ingredients that took their food from what one might find at home to dishes one might find in the best hotels along Beirut's Corniche.

**********
For his main course, or ""mashawi"" - a rough equivalent to the Italian ""secondo"" - my friend ordered kawarma - Suraya's grilled and slow-roasted lamb, which was rubbed with ""baharat,"" a mixture of black pepper, allspice, cardamom and other savory spices.

I tasted his meal, which was delectable. Then I savored my own fork-tender, succulent, almost buttery portion of goat ribs and loin. I'm embarrassed to say that I gloated as I announced that my plate won the evening.

Finally, as a bonus, Suraya only offers roasted goat every few weeks - ten orders per night - and by coming across it when I did, I lucked out. 

So really; thanks again, Zahav.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1ef54dc13e8c0e3417""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Active Life, Beer Gardens, Grocery, Middle Eastern, Specialty Food, American (New), Parks, Cafes, Food, Nightlife, Restaurants, Coffee & Tea, Lebanese"",""business_id"":""vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g"",""name"":""Suraya""}]"

Service was phenomenal! And my Ahi poke bowl actually begs me to return. Prices could have been lower, but they seemed quite standard for poke establishments. (The $1 extra for the guacamole was well worth the upcharge-- great guac!)

If you've been to the De La Vina location these are the same owners serving up their ever so popular Al Pastor tacos. But the price has increased to $1.99 as opposed to the $1.75, but that's ok! Still worth it to me. The tortillas are handmade so that makes them extra special.

The location is not the best with a small parking lot of 10 spaces available, but there is street parking on Nogal.  

Occupany is for about 28 people. 

The menu at this location will be expanding and soon they will be open for breakfast serving up burritos, coffee, and milkshakes. Say whaat? Milkshakes for breakfast? Yes that's right. Flavors will be strawberry, banana, papaya, and mango. Tortas coming soon as well.

Today was the second day they have been open 2.23.16, so they're still trying to ease on in at this new location. 

If you have any suggestions or recommendations don't be afraid to speak up to the staff! Noe who is one of the family staff members says they love to hear feedback on any improvements. Pleasing the customer is their top priority. 

Today I had 2 Al Pastor tacos, and one carne asada. I wish I had ordered 4 because the meat was perfectly cooked! Juicy and delicious.

geBSZTzgGJ3V8YAb_mtBqQ,3StNEgKAwpCFR1q0urmJrw,5,86,"We came to Raijin on a Sunday night for dinner to celebrate a good friend's promotion.  Parking was limited and most patrons had to find parallel spots on the street.  

Our party had to wait outside in line but were called in within 15 minutes to wait on the inside benches.  We were seated shortly after that in a comfortable booth that accommodated 4 easily, but anymore would have been a stretch.

We were started with waters and deliciously fruity chu hi drinks (Japanese soju highballs with surprisingly high alcoholic content).  After browsing other Yelp reviews, I knew I wanted to try many of their appetizers so I ordered takoyaki, karaage, fried octopus, and gyoza to share.  Everything came out very quickly and piping hot.  The fried dishes were perfectly crunchy and golden.  The gyozas was bathed in dumpling sauce but was somehow still crispy.

Entrees also arrived quickly and were very hot.  I ordered the black garlic tonkotsu.  Presentation was gorgeous and the serving was generous.  It came with bamboo, half of a soft boiled egg, and a thick slice of pork, all topped with black edamame seeds.  The garlic in the broth was not overpowering and all flavors were excellent complements.

I would dare say the food was Los Angeles-caliber good.  Service was fast and friendly.  The price was very reasonable.  Four appetizers and four ramen entrees came out to about $110.

We were celebrating and a small group of us decided to try something adventurous. We already had experienced the talents of Chef Baldino and tonight after getting into town I let this talented Chef  create and serve to us whatever he wanted. 

It was a memorable and delicious evening. So many plates that I am sure I will leave some out, however I want to emphasize, everything was top notch.

We started with a rich Homemade Ravioli stuffed with what tasted like the Chef's Gnocchi, served in a Brown Butter Sauce. Melt in our mouths goodness. 

Then we were served Cockle Clams with Sausage in an incredible broth. On another plate fresh prepared Artichoke Hearts under very well seasoned Bread Crumbs. Ka-Pow goodness.

Next Courses were three delectable Pasta Dishes. One with Oil, Garlic and Broccoli Rabe. A fantastic Plate of Pasta with a Rabbit Ragu. Wow, And the third plate of Pasta was the I believe was the Troffiette. Each of these dishes were wonderful.

Next Course was  a Fish, served whole almost like a Branzino. Our Server, Tommy did a wonderful job cleaning the fall off the bone tender fish. There was not a bone found. 

Meat Course was the Marinated rib-eye steak served with arugula and tomato salad. Magnificently Cooked and Fork Tender. Just the perfect amount of Garlic seasoning. The arugula and Tomato salad was tremendous. Some at the table mentioned how the Chef and its Kitchen's wonderful staff finds an out of season Tomato which tasted amazing. The Steak tasted as good if not better than any Steak House I have visited.

We were loosening our belts at this point.

Dessert was as good as good gets.

A Flourless Chocolate Cake, A Vanilla Homemade Gelato, and 3 out of this world after dinner aperitifs. One a Pistachio Flavored, One a Star Anise flavored, and the last a non flavored Cello. Simply delicious. 

Each and every one who joined me enjoyed the evening immensely, the service was terrific, and the center of everyone's attention was some of the finest Italian Food I have ever had the pleasure of eating.

Your best bet to get to this heavenly, and yes, I mean HEAVENLY place (these donuts have officially provided me with an out of body experience) would be to drive your car and park on the sidewalk. Now with that being said, there's plenty of seats inside and outside of the place! Upon approaching the register, the woman working the counter gave us recommendations as I was looking into the gates of heaven. About eight donuts that are laid out inside of a small counter, with the workers constantly firing out more. 

Exciting to say the least, I could feel the donuts calling me, ""Jimmy, we're HERE! What you've been waiting so long for!"" They were right, this place was always on the corner of my mind while walking through New Orleans. My first time coming here, I absolutely had to get four of them. Now enough of me talking, let's get into the donuts themselves:

Banana Cream Donut (5/5):

I thought that the donut itself would be dry with regards to the numerous other donuts I've eaten. Boy was I wrong! After the first bite, I could taste the glaze along with a hint of banana cream. Who knew there was a filling? I was expecting just a plain white cream filling, however, that wasn't the case! The guys hear at District Donuts put time into their donuts, and you can taste it! The added touch of the two banana pieces on top which actually were caramelized, made this treat twenty times better. Definitely the best one of the four so far! 

Boston Cream Pie (4.5/5):

Identical was how I would describe this one. Perfect yet identical. This donut wasn't a disappointment in any aspect. If you've ever had a real Boston cream pie, this would be an exact replica. The cream inside is delicious but fluffy. Delicate, and not overpoweringly sweet. The chocolate glaze on top was moist and appealing on the pallet, almost like New Year's Eve fireworks (except you know, in your mouth).

Now, the other two donuts I chose were toasted coconut and lemon raspberry. Both of those for my parents, because sharing is caring! Overall, just being able to see the staff at District Donuts working hard with regards to making their fresh donuts combined with the delicious quality of the donuts were enough for me to say that I will be back, but hungrier, for more donuts!

My two-egg breakfast @ $8.99 plus a pancake ($1.99) was very good. My companion's Hawaiian Melt (ham, cheese, & pineapple) w/ a side of fruit @ $7.99 was also very good, although the ham ratio was too high. 

Service was down home neighborly. The decor in this small, narrow dining room is charmingly tacky, & expected w/ an ol' time country diner. I won't hesitate to stop in whenever I'm in the area. I believe I hear the Pumpkin Waffles calling:)

Open 7 days weekly, but just till 3 PM on Saturday & Sunday.

Recently I made a trip to New Orleans for Mardi Gras and District Donuts was on my radar all the way from Los Angeles! Um yeah... I can sniff out good donuts from hundreds of miles away! 

 When I first walked in there was a line, but that didn't deter me. I was only worried they might run out of donuts and I was anxious to get my order in. The line looked pretty long but it only took me about 10 minutes to get through it. I was a overwhelmed because I wanted to try...um..all of them but I can only eat so much. When I finally got to the front of the line I found out my biggest nightmare had came true, they were sold out of the King cake donut, and that was the one I was really looking forward to trying! I asked them if I could pre-order it and wait to the side because they were cooking them, but they said they couldn't do that. I understood because there were so many people that wanted them that people pre-ordering could get confusing. 

If you're not familiar what king cake is, it is a cake during Mardi Gras in New Orleans that is covered with different colors like pink, purple, and yellow. Inside they hide a baby. The tradition is, whoever finds the baby in the king cake has to buy the next king cake. These cakes are very popular during Mardi Gras. 

I ended up buying a box of donut. It included the Wedding cake donut, the NOLA, Red velvet, and the Spicy Maple Praline donuts. I also got a buttermilk drop (it's like a buttermilk biscuit that taste like a donut), a buttermilk biscuit and chocolate chip cookies. Don't judge, I shared all my goodies with a group of friends, that way I could taste everything. For full enjoyment I advise you buy all the above or you will be cheating yourself! 

While I was sitting in the store eating my donuts the owner came up and asked me if I wanted a king cake donut. He had heard the commotion I made at the counter about wanting a King Cake donut and my disappointment. I thought that was really awesome, and I didn't have to wait in line. Thank you Aaron! 

Unfortunately I was so focused on their donuts I missed out on getting some of their breakfast sandwiches and the Croquenuts (griddled donut sandwiches). They look so good that I could kick myself for not trying at least 3 of them each! 

Most importantly donut lovers, District Donuts  changes their donuts daily, which is a good and a bad thing. The good thing is there is a bunch of different kind of donuts that seem endless. The bad news is I don't live in New Orleans so I won't be able to try them all. If you live out here take advantage of how lucky you are. Here's a list of just a few of the donuts they have....

ok5zSpq9yH8o1PFK3GA7vQ,koeubKPpi6ax4FDh7_zcWg,5,51,"Palo de Azucar Cafe (Sugar Stick Cafe) is the second coffee house at this location that was an old time Italian deli for over fifty years before changing hands. I was a customer of that antique urban store, and loved their breakfast sandwiches, especially the sausage, egg and cheese creation. The old grill in the back room turned out many a delicious meal. 

So, when I saw that the new place had a morning menu including a SEC sammy, I know the temptation to explore that offering would be too great to let me stay away for long. 

And, so it was. I walked in today after finding a parking spot open in front. The room looked the same as the first cafe, but with interesting artwork on the walls, and a very pleasant crew of baristas handling the preparations on the polished stainless Expresso maker. I asked for the sandwich and large coffee, and looked around while waiting for it to be completed. Clean and well maintained. 

I watched as one of the women made my bagel sandwich on the small grills on the back shelf. Double meat. Double soft fried egg. Double cheese. She and I had a brief conversation about how Trenton had changed over the years (not all for the better, we agreed), but certainly with new life springing up in the shadows of this former ""All American City."" She constructed the layers of ingredients and nicely packaged it for my trip down the street to the office. That sticky decal with the cafe's logo was a very nice touch. 

Saving the best for last, the sandwich was among the best desayunos I've had the pleasure to consume. It was loaded, and each bite an explosion of tastes and textures, as my teeth slices through it. Amazing how exponentially better doubling the contents made the dish. A bagel is leaky by design, but it wasn't so extrusive as to require extreme caution. Yes, my fingers were involved in picking up all that fell out. It was all too good to waste. The coffee was a medium roast that continues to hold its flavor without bitterness to this very moment. 

At five minutes from the office, Palo de Azucar is too good to not become a regular morning stop. The sandwich so reminded me of the old guy cooking in the backroom, that it was almost like he was still around. 

Great way to commemorate the great grandfather of the shop by allowing his spirit to shine through.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0df576""},""stars"":""5"",""categories"":""Cafes, Restaurants, Food, Coffee & Tea"",""business_id"":""koeubKPpi6ax4FDh7_zcWg"",""name"":""Palo De Azucar Cafe""}]"

When you supposedly had the best Hainanese chicken in the world in Singapore (Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken) from the likes of Anthony Bourdain and Mike Chen and this place tops that, that is saying a lot! And I didn't have to sweat my tush like I did the other place which was at a hawker. This is Hainanese Chicken THAI style.

We wanted to try both of their boiled and fried chicken so we ordered the Set 3: Boneless Chicken with 3 Sets of Soup & Ginger Chicken Rice. One of the things I love about chicken flavored rice is the fresh grated ginger. The clear radish soup had a nice kick to it. The meal is accompanied by three different dipping sauces. But the chicken is the star...super juicy and perfectly cooked. We all favored the fried chicken, the crispiness of the skin was tasty and not oily. At the end of the plate were some gizzards and liver. Aside from their famous chicken dishes, there are many noodle, fried rice and curry dishes.

This place is tiny with only a few tables. Best to come here as soon as it opens or do takeout so you don't have to wait.

RKyNdQaczRYK8xjYJdXdlQ,gCuC7255XLP-KGuFqYFaSw,5,71,"Lou Malnati's  is a genuine Chicago deep dish and pizza giant hailing from Chicago that has opened some locations in Indianapolis. This particular location in the vibrant broad ripple neighborhood of the city. 

Me and my family are on a weekend at getaway to Indy from louisville as my daughter has a cheer comp. My niece team is also in town cheering so we all got together for dinner on night one. Me being a huge fan of the original Lou Malnati's in Chicago I was stoked to see one come closer to our home city. So where to dine night one was a no brainer. 

We walked into This circus themed establishment filled with fun signs and Art and playhouse mirrors on a Friday night. Place was mildly crowded but they had a booth in the back that could fit are large party so we sat down immediately. 

Now I'll preface This review with the opinion that Lou Malnati's is the best pizza I've ever had. I held this opinion coming in. So I was expecting a 5 star dining experience. Which we did receive. There deep dish chicago style pizzas are as delish in Indiana as they are in Illinois. I'm sure they would be great in Kentucky too (hint hint for any Lou Malnati's decision makers who may want to invest in a Lousiville location). 

We started off with two apps as the kids were hungry and genuine Chicago deep dish takes some time to prepare. We aren't Chicago deep dish Rookies so we know the deal on waiting. We got an order of calamari and an order of cheese sticks.  The calamari was solid. Very chewy compared to others and the sauce they use had a different type of spice to it that I'm not quite sure worked for any of us. We all ended up dipping in the mozzarella sticks sauce. The mozzarella sticks were great. Very good flavor and nice and cheesy. 

For our entree we got a large and medium Chicago deep dish cheese, my father got a 3 meet deep dish personal pan, my wife got a massive salad, a picky nephew got a thin crust cheese pizza and my mom got a stuffed spinach bread. So we did some sampling. All the pizzas were great (we knew they would be). My wife said her salad was fantastic and my mom loved her spinach bread and was shocked at how filling it was. 

Overall great experience. Good service, fun vibe and family atmosphere and of course that classic Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza. I'm seriously envious of our Indiana neighbors 2 hours down the road. It would be great to have a Lou Malnati's in our hometown of Lousiville!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0df592""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Pizza, Restaurants, Italian"",""business_id"":""gCuC7255XLP-KGuFqYFaSw"",""name"":""Lou Malnati's Pizzeria  - Now Open!""}]"

While small in size with only a few hightops and an loveseat, it is warm and welcoming due to the hard work of the owner, Barbara, who wears her heart on her sleeve and makes everyone feel like family. 

I was looking for a good cuppa joe and a light early repast when this place jumped onto my Yelp screen. I parked across the street at a meter ($.25/hour), and crossed Main Street (York Road) to get to the door. I was the only customer when I arrived and had a few moments to chat with the proprietress as she expressod my Cafe Americano and walked back into the kitchen to put together my breakfast sammy on an everything bagel. Let me just say that I felt much compassion and sympathy for her as she spoke about her current circumstances. Stop by if you want to know more.

The coffee was excellent. Roasted by Valerio in Audobon, PA, it was rich, darkly volcanic soil based, and full of nutty and savory fruit tones. Probably should have purchased a bag of their Congo whole beans, but thought I might visit their roasterie and get it there I was so impressed. The sandwich (sausage, egg & Swiss) was also very good, but not as memorable as the java. They did harmonize well together, though. 

I do hope all goes well for the family, and that Mad Hatter stays a magical place for superior coffee and a comfortable time out.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e265c""},""stars"":""5"",""categories"":""Coffee & Tea, Sandwiches, Cafes, Soup, Food, Restaurants"",""business_id"":""idVfZKAHYec4C3VevKgkag"",""name"":""Mad Hatter Cafe""}]"

I was extremely impressed w/ this business-- the amount of physical space, the number of rooms, the beer varities, the ECLECTIC MENU, the interior's aesthetics (although it's loud & not a good place for an intimate gathering!), & the friendliness of staff, which includes the male manager. 

I arrived during a closed event; the business was open for just VIPs. The very friendly manager gave me permission to take photos,  & twice thanked me for doing so. 

There currently are 16 beers available, most offered in cans & on draft. Also available is a fruited drink: Blueberry Cobbler Pastry Sour. Prices range from $6.50 - $14. Look for 10 cocktails ($11 - $13), 2 sparking wines, 4 white wines, Rose', & Reds.

One of the most iconic things about Mike's is definitely the location, in beautiful downtown Nashville. With country music blaring and tourists walking around, it kind of almost feels like home! Once I walked into Mike's the place was packed, and the weather, chilly as ever! Seeing as I was only spending a few days here, I had to go big, triple scoop for $5.50!

Here's the flavors I got:

Red Velvet Cake (4/5):

Chunks of red velvet cake, and the color of the ice cream was a dark red! Something out of a Dr. Seuss book almost! What I loved most about it was the fact that the pieces of cake inside the ice cream were delicate and not dry. Actually pretty moist in combination with the ice cream!

Tennessee Fudge (4.5/5):

Come on now, we're in Nashville, I can't NOT get Tennessee Fudge! Almost like cookies and cream, but the pieces of cookie were bigger and tastier! It was rather delicate on the pallet, and definitely fulfilled my needs as a person with a sweet tooth!

Caramel Cone (4.2/5)

Little chunks of caramel lodged into the ice cream along with a good amount of caramels drizzle, this one was definitely flattering! 

Overall, sitting at Mike's and staring out of the window, it kind of reminded me of a scene in movie.

I've been to Dave's at the Milpas location but it's hard for me to get down there, so I was thrilled when I heard about this new location specifically open for lunch! 

Dave has a lunch special for $10! This will get you a choice of any two dogs on the menu, chips, and a beverage. Great deal especially for these specialty dogs made with lots of love. 

What did I order? 

The Mac n cheese dog (secret special of the day)
Western Dog

The Mac n cheese was very creamy, the bacon gave it a nice flavor. This is not something I would eat frequently because it's pretty rich, but I'm glad I could finally see what it was all about.

The Western Dog served with bacon, jalapeño slices, onion, and a bbq siracha mayo was my favorite. The jalapeños give it that spicy kick along with the Siracha mayo but it's not too spicy where it's burning up your mouth unless you happen to eat one of the jalapeno seeds then you're done. So eat with caution!

Dave was very welcoming and even though I visited his spot on Milpas St. he was still kind enough to give us the rundown on the menu. Thank you Dave!!

KZb-3LEjHkhVDyQoh2KRmw,oY-w5FbUv8YPA-vJmkdW1Q,5,54,"It is really nice to have expectations exceeded by a local slow/fast food shop. That was exactly what happened yesterday when we visited Curly's Comfort Food in Levittown, PA. 

Why ""slow/fast""? Because although Curly does cheesesteaks, burgers, chicken and all the accessories, which are typically considered fast food; it is so slammed with people ordering and waiting for their food that the first thing the ordertaker said to me was that there was a one hour wait for pickup. After ordering their Diablo Cheesesteak with fried onions, Firecracker Crisp Chicken Sandwich and standard Burger, she asked for my phone number to be able to alert me when the kitchen had prepared everything. Well, okay. We walked across the parking field to the H Mart for a little casual shopping in that well stocked Asian market. 

All the reviews suggesting the Curly's cheesesteak is the best of breed in the region. That is no lie! My son opened a zoftig sesame seeded long torpedo roll with enough thin sliced beef, cheese, jalapenos, and onions to fill at least two regular sized 'steaks.' He cut off a two inch end of the massive creation for me to taste, and he still couldn't finish it. My small sampling left me wanting more. It was a perfect roll wrapped around a glorious mix of deliciously delivered ingredients, complete with raw onion and sliced tomato. 

Simply stunning! 

The Firecracker Chicken wasn't far behind. Breaded and deep fried, it was a large breast with strong spice content, mayo, lettuce and tomato. I felt sorry for the round Kaiser roll attempting to hold it all together. It really couldn't, so before I was half way through it, I grabbed a knife and fork to assist. It was also excellent, and an unspoken contender in the chicken sandwich wars being waged by the franchises. Watch out, Popeye's and Chik-Fil-A! 

The burger was the simplest on the menu, but still a half pounder surrounded by a copious load of pretty good fries, in the same Kaiser roll, with the requested medium finish. Who ever heard of a takeout joint paying enough attention at the grill to deliver the right doneness? Curly did! 

Sure, the bill for all this quantity and quality was in the mid $40s. As I paid with that 3% credit card surcharge, I hoped it would all be worthwhile. Truth is that it was worth every penny and perhaps more, although that surcharge is obnoxious, and they would be doing a civic service to eliminate that, as it discriminates against the majority of consumers who are part of our credit economy.

PRO TIP - You have to ask them to switch the Diablo Chicken Steak to a Beef version which was not on the paper menu. It costs a little more, but definitely the way to go.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0e05e7""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Comfort Food, Restaurants, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Burgers"",""business_id"":""oY-w5FbUv8YPA-vJmkdW1Q"",""name"":""Curly's Comfort Food""}]"

They recently reopened after a lengthy renovation, and although the vibe is the same, it does appear cleaner on the dining room floor and likely in the kitchen, too. 

While food from Chengdu and Chongqing is more common here these days than it was decades ago, it remains an acquired taste for most consumers with its heavy hot chili spice and oil content. It is nothing like the sweeter Cantonese offerings found in Chinese American joints across the continent. For me the shift to preferring the numbing black peppercorns and flaming small red chillies over General Tso and the rest, came from my prolonged exposure to the kitchen heat during eight years I spent working and exploring the Middle Kingdom, primarily in Szechuan and Yunnan provinces. For me, eating this style food brings me back to the adventurous days when I became acculturated to this cooking, and loved life there. 

I would never say this is the best representation of Szechuanese cuisine in the western world, but it is damn good and satisfying. Yes, part of its attraction for me is reminiscing about the past, and they do need to use more peppercorns to capture the numbing elements of what I like most, but unless I want to travel to China to satisfy my yearnings, Szechuan House is about as good as it gets for the gestalt I seek. 

PS. Yes, Philly has some very strong candidates - Han Dynasty, Chili Szechuan, Chengdu Famous, Four Rivers and Ermi, among the best - they are not appreciably superior to S.H., although I love them all.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c18f54dc13e8c0ddbe2""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Chinese, Szechuan"",""business_id"":""A9rVxmIBtHZRvNhbBaGAWg"",""name"":""Szechuan House""}]"

The attention to detail is amazing from the welcoming tiles in the parking garage to the pleasant smell of flowers when you get on the elevator.

It has a perfect low-key appeal and design that feels ""Santa Barbara"" without the artificiality of primarily using white stucco and orange tiled roofs to fit local vibe like some fancy hotels in the area. Very cool place to stay and we loved it. The rooms are eclectic but memorable and we enjoyed resting in some of the public areas like the fireplace and fountain. 

The rooms have a GIANT bathtub for you to soak in and my wife was all chill and calm until she saw the shampoos, soap, and lotion were from ""Diptique"" and she went crazy texting her friends while I wondered why it felt slimy and made my eyes burn.

Location is tops, its easily walkable to some of the heavy-hitting sites and eateries in the Presido area, the longest we had to drive to anywhere else was 10 minutes.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e298b""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Cafes, Restaurants, Hotels"",""business_id"":""1wvYBjX6radqmb_k0Fv_Ug"",""name"":""Palihouse Santa Barbara""}]"

Designated Driver - $35

If you're thinking of checking out this festival be sure to look out for it on Groupon! They offer a great discounted price but you must act fast since this event is pretty popular.

The choices of wine vendors is endless and you're bound to find one you will love! There is no way you will be able to cover everything with at least over 100 choices or so it seemed. There are a few beer stands for you beer lovers as well. Water is provided so be sure to stay hydrated! 

The entrance was well organized and once you walk in you are greeted with a nice souvenir glass to take with you along with a plate for all the goodies they have to sample. The most popular stand and the very first one you should hit up is Gelsons. They provide a beautiful spread of cheese, crackers, pepper jelly, and fruits. 

The second popular stand was Joya Sangria. They offer a red, white, and Rosé Sangria. The winner here was the red! I tried the Rosé and it wasn't too bad. A little on the sweeter side for me but still refreshing with ice. The pours here are very generous! 

There are a ton of vendors who not only offer samples but you can also purchase them at a discounted price such as organic raw honey, olive oils, toffee, and much more. 

Overall this event is a must and what more could you ask for with the location being centered at our beautiful beach.

xSkAJMQKLy3a4MNPa-7prA,b1okJ5qEPCIHbIgQ1NGyXQ,5,56,"Ok South Philly, I see you! From the owners of local brunch favorite Cafe y Chocolate (located just across the street), is this sweet ""New Mexican"" spot offering up dishes with tons of Latin flair and South American inspired ingredients you may not be able to pronounce. Try them! Trust me! Don't let the surroundings fool you, this cash only place is super legit and I warmly welcome it to this slowly, but surely flourishing neighborhood. This section of the city has been dubbed ""Puebladelphia"" due to it's plethora of no frills, damn good Mexican joints. This one however is more high end and a true stand out! 

We stopped by for lunch with the littles, chose a seat by the window on a gorgeous sunny Saturday afternoon. We sat upon floral cushions and had the entire place to ourselves. We looked around at tiny details... Christmas light strands, cacti and cool light ceiling fixtures. (Look up!). I thought to myself ""this cute, cozy space which they light with candles when it's dark, would be great for date night"", and after tasting what they had to offer, finding out they are BYO with mixers for purchase, I know one is in our near future! 

We were presented immediately with complimentary pineapple drizzled with a sweet sauce and topped with a not so overly spicy chili/salt blend. This simple starter was delish and much appreciated. Perfect balance of tart and spice. Nice touch! 

We started with the 'Esquites' $8 (roasted corn, epazote, garlic, lime, mayonnaise and cheese). Think Mexican Street corn, but off the cob! Squeeze a little of that lime and dig in! Great for sharing and these tasty kernels are also found in the squash blossom quesadilla. 

Hubs ordered the 'Pescado Frito' app for $8 and said it was one of the best breaded fish he has tasted. Nice bites of perfectly fried white fish served with a tangy dipping sauce. 

I chose the 'Vegetales' $14 (huitlacoche, Peruvian potato, mushrooms, chamomile, jalapeño, zucchini blossom purée). It was absolutely packed with flavor and quite delicious!! Meaty mushrooms, perfectly roasted potatoes and big hunks of zucchini served over smeared goodness. I could've licked that plate clean! What may seem a simple veggie dish was taken another level with the fragrant spices and flavors! So good! 

For the kiddos, we asked if they could make them a plain cheese quesadilla for which they charged $10 and had no issue obliging us. We were able to chose between corn or flour tortilla. We chose corn and they enjoyed a lot! This and the roasted corn app are great options for the wee ones!

We sipped on Jarittos and Coca Cola in old school bottles. Love that! The Mexican camomile tea under the drink section caught my eye also. Definitely trying that next time! 

Everything was the created with upmost care and presented just the same. Service was top notch and we were properly and patiently explained a few items we unsure of. We even got to meet the owner Arturo during our visit. I told him what a fan we were of his spot across the street and he thanked us! Both the waiter and owner were very kind, warm and welcoming. 

I can assure that you are in for a special, super flavorful, unique Mexican meal here in this tiny, corner BYO deep in South Philly. We all left highly impressed!

 From shrimp and chorizo apps, fresh cactus and avocado salads, to soups and stews, more casual street fare, larger platters which include skirt and hanger steaks, lamb shoulder, pork, chicken, beef and salmon, and desserts including truffles and hibiscus agave ice cream, you are bound to find something new and extremely tasty to enjoy. There's a little something for every palette, including fellow veg-heads. This isn't your average Mexican joint for sure.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1bf54dc13e8c0e08a1""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""American (New), Restaurants, Tacos, Mexican, Latin American, Vegetarian, New Mexican Cuisine, Breakfast & Brunch"",""business_id"":""b1okJ5qEPCIHbIgQ1NGyXQ"",""name"":""La Mula Terca""}]"

They charge per Oz and the tap monitors how much you pour. Very cool concept, I love tapas so this is like tapas beer! 

Along with the beer, the food was also really good, could not find a single complaint. Started with the fried mozzarella and meatball lollipops. Had fresh basil on top and were really delicious. 

My husband had the double-double burger. He loved it. I had the shrimp scampi pizza and I loved it! Waitress was good.

Deep down in Philadelphia close to South Street
Way back up by the Docks among the Philadelpheans
There stood a little basket with a plastic fork
From a sandwich shop named John's Roast Pork
Nobody ever learned to make pork so well
But it's the best you'll ever taste, you can tell by the smell

Go go... go to John's, go, go...
Go to John's, go...
Go to John's go...
Go to John's, go, go, go...
Johnny's Roast Pork!

If they sell the place to the Radiohead singer, who tends to leave parties without saying goodbye, and stop texting people he's been frantically sexting with, then it'll be renamed ""Thom 'Ghost' Yorke.""

John's Roast Pork is not only the best sandwich in Philadelphia. It may be the best sandwich in the United States. 

It's also extraordinary and unique, much moreso than a cheesesteak. I've never had anything remotely like it outside Philly, and nowhere else in Philly makes it this well. The Cheesesteak got the fame, but the Roast Pork is the secret reason to travel to the City of Brotherly Love. And with Tommy DiNic's a respectable second-best, this is *the* place to get Roast Pork in Philly.

If it were a show on Comedy Central where Leguizamo, Lovitz and Travolta jokingly insult the late Robin Williams (RIP), then it'd be ""Johns Roast Mork.""

What to get: Roast Pork sandwich with extra spinach, extra sharp provolone, wet.
Make sure: That you eat it while it's hot and wet. If you're eating it later, don't even bother.
And make sure: To check their hours. They open & close early. They're gone by 3 daily.
And also: They go on vacation sometimes in summer. So it's better to call and check.

If it were owned by the Mafia, it'd be Don's Roast Pork.

This sandwich is so good because of:

(a) dripping wetness and baked in heat. Juicy to the final bite.
(b) extremely heavy on the garlic, with a divine blend of spices.
(c) the spinach is magnificent, and the extra sharp provolone is melty, strong, and perfect.
(d) the pork itself is tender, thinly sliced, delicious, marinaded and magnificent.

If they stopped giving out spoons and forks, and instead gave out a combo-hybrid, then you could say ""John's Boasts Sporks.""

But it's not all about the Roast Pork. I'm not a massive fan of Cheesesteaks, but honestly, I think the John's Cheesesteak tastes better than any of the more famous rivals. I'd never come here for just a cheesesteak with the Roast Pork on offer, but sometimes I'll get one of each to share with an out-of-towner, and the conclusion is usually the same: The Pork is the food of the Gods. The Cheesesteak is not as good, but is the best Cheesesteak they've tried.

If you get drunk on wine here, or lose your virginity here (or both), you can call it ""John's Popped Cork.""

Roast Pork is not the only sandwich which Philly does very well (aside from the obvious). Try Nick's Old Roast Beef on 20th St, also with X-sharp Provolone. It's one of the best Roast Beef sandwiches in the nation.

If they're having a party for actor Mickey, and you all raise your glasses to him, then it's named ""John's Toast Rourke.""

I was annoyed when watching the food shows on TV, who always hype up Tommy DiNic's (excellent, but second best), and Tony Luke's (not even on the same planet, dry and much less flavourful), and allow John's to play second-fiddle when it's by far the best. It's all hype. Come here and treat yourself to one of the best sandwiches you will ever try.

And if the owner tells you that your wrist pains are probably from all of the twisting and pulling you do at the gym, then it can be said that ""John's Diagnosed Torque.""

And if you and the owner get it on with a wild Icelandic singer in a 3-way (it's okay if it's in a three way, Gaga told me so), then perhaps it's ""John's Spit-roast Bjork.""

Now back to Marty McFly.

I used to have their sandwich in a gunny sack
Go eat beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the Philly girls would see me sitting in the shade
And come and share the sandwich that John's Roast Pork made
And after we made out*, every girl would say
That's the best damn sandwich in the USA**

Go go... go to John's, go, go...
Go to John's, go...
Go to John's go...
Go to John's, go, go, go...
Johnny's Roast Pork!



* since we both ate the Garlic-infused pork, the make out session wasn't gross for either of us. I'm a wily one, see.

** I know I've called a few sandwiches the best in the USA, but you need to just trust me and try every single one of them. K. Thx.

From the perfectly fried golden outer half moon shell to the favor-packed shredded beef, black beans, & plantains that grace the soft inside, there is no escaping falling in love w/ this Venezuelan culinary creation. Once you dip this delightful production into the delicious cilantro-laden yellowish sauce, the only thing you'll crave is a long, slow puff on a figurative cigarette:) Seriously, this national dish is ASOMBROSA! 

Check out the pics before heading on over to try this delectable sensation served w/ a free & GENEROUS side of VERY friendly service! The dining room is spacious & clean w/ its high ceilings & modern colorblock of bright orange & neon green. Order @ the counter then sit & wait for each dish to be prepared fresh. 

Some history: Owners Jesus & Carmen originate from Venezuela; in Nov 2014, they opened the doors to welcome hungry & soon happy patrons to this family-owned business. Chef Carmen, a former math & physics teacher, created the dishes which cross the cultural divide by fusing Venezuelan & Lebanese flavors. The results are EXCELLENT! 

What possibly is left to say about such a worthy eatery other than a couple of relatable Venezuelan sayings: When you are ""Hungrier than a tick on a stuffed toy,"" head on over to Are Pita. RUN-- don't walk, because ""Hungry love doesn't last."" The PABELLON EMPANADA on your plate will not be there long.

Today it was a snow day (weekday) lunch with the family. I have been numerous times for breakfast, coffee and croissants, eggs.. many lunches with friends, my fave is the French onion soup and salad lyonnaise. Although other lunches I've loved have been the croque madame and salad nisoise..and my son loves the mac and cheese. The bread basket is the best in town and we fight over the baguette slices. I also regularly buy baguettes from the front desk for $3, (at least every other week) great with dinner at home.

Yup I'm starting with that.
Listen here...I've been trying to get a cheesesteak at this place for the past few months, but every time I'm in the area the line is around the corner. Finally I drive by this time and the line is reasonable! I dropped the wife and kid off at chick-fil-a and headed right back to get in line. 
I brought a bottle of water with me anticipating an hour between waiting, ordering, and waiting some more. I met a nice woman and her daughter in line who were also cheesesteak adventure seekers as well who made the wait feel a lot shorter (even tho it was still overall an hour.) 
Once I had that cheese steak in hand, I said goodbye to my cheese steak  line friends and headed to pick up the fam. Even tho the cheese steak had been sitting 30 min before I could eat it, that first bite solidified it being literally THE BEST CHEESE STEAK I'VE EVER HAD so far!
Why?? Because it wasn't small, nor overcooked, nor soggy, nor unseasoned. It was tasty even without ketchup! Of course I got mine with fried onions and mayo just an FYI. Even the roll had that strong good ole philly roll flavor. I was just sad it was ending as I came upon the last few bites. I don't even want to have another cheese steak anywhere else.

Of those updates, there are only a handful of places I've bothered to review more that twice. This is now my third review of Wat!

I say that to emphasize the fact that this unassuming place with incredibly reasonable prices and no fancy dishware or super modern decor, no roof or walls in fact, is one of my favorite places to eat on earth. I've been coming here for six years consistently. As a matter of fact, I don't schedule a visit to Tampa that doesn't include a Sunday morning with 3 hours set aside to visit Wat Mongkolratanaram. I would consider it gross negligence and an injustice to my digestive system. Yes there is a lot of fried and/or high carb foods here! But if your gonna die (as we all will)... die happy!


The reason for this update is to inform all you potential patrons of a few changes:
A) Many of the vendors often begin serving food much earlier than the 9am start time.
B) The people that once used to make the fried custards are no longer in business.  
C) The curry station has moves to the opposite side of the venue in order to make more room for the beef noodle line (the longest line of any of the vendors). 
D) The food is still awesome and the vendors still very friendly and reasonably priced.


[ MUST TRY ITEMS ]

* THAI FRIED CHICKEN WINGS - To date there is only one vendor that serves fried chicken wings, so they shouldn't be hard to find. 

* MANGO & STICKY RICE -  The same vendor that serves the fried wings also serves the best sticky rice. Trust me when I say, buy a minimum of one container for every two people in your party. We love it so much that we buy one for each of us.

PUMPKIN CURRY CHICKEN - Just get it!!! If you love curry chicken you'll be delighted by the flavor. Please note the pumpkin adds a touch of sweetness.

THAI BEEF NOODLE SOUP - I still prefer PHO to any noodle soup, but this is a lovely treat on a Sunday morning. It was particularly nice on this visit considering it was a fairly cold November morning for Tampa.



[ FINAL THOUGHTS ]

So many great selections at great prices. I literally hand my kids $20 each and let them go find whatever they want to eat... and that is on top of my paying for each of us to have a bowl of Beef Noodle Soup. This is the one place in all our travels where every family member is always eager to return. It's not just great food and reasonable prices, it's an experience, one I hope someday everyone reading this review will get a chance to share. If you do nothing else in life specifically for you, find someplace that you can have a WONDERFUL meal and treat yourself as often as needed!

SIDE NOTE: Our other must visit Tampa food experience is Armature Works and market. A place where food lovers can gather in a super cool and comfy foodie utopia.

Each and every time I have received excellent:

-Customer service...
The two brothers who work here remember my partner's and my names, plus always smile while carrying on a friendly conversation.

-Food...
Their food is absolutely spectacular and is easily at the top of my list for Italian cuisine in Santa Barbara County. Deliciousness starts with the appetizers and continues through to dessert. Their seafood dishes are always fresh and pasta cooked perfectly al dente. Oh and their thin crust pizzas are not to be missed either!

-Ambiance...
Given the strip mall corner unit location, you wouldn't know the interior is as large as it is! They have minimal yet elegant decor, dim lighting, and a lovely outdoor patio with a fountain.

Most recently, my family took advantage of Ca' Dario's New Year's Eve pre-fixe meals for $85. It came with a small plate of choice, lasagna, main entree, and an included bottle of Dard wine.

It's time to see if these places are as good as I remember, if they've taken a nose dive or if they have risen from the pit of mediocrity into something worthy of updating.


THE EXPERIENCE

I'm happy to report Wat Mongkolratnaram is actually more deserving of 5 stars now than they were then. Since my 2013 visit I've been back here a few times (twice in 2015) and each has been a fantastic experience. During our Spring Break, we explored the side of the property where the monks live and got to see their offices, kitchen and worship areas. We were not allowed in the sleeping quarters, but everything else was open. We also spent that visit trying different foods from different vendors. Some we like, some we didn't.  During our Christmas Vacation, we concentrated instead on the foods we already know and love - Mango Sticky Rice, Beef Noodle Soup, Thai Fried Chicken Wings and Thai tea. Each seemed to be even more spectacular than the last time we ate here. 

It was a perfect Florida winter's day where the temperature, by Atlanta standards, was t-shirt weather! We arrived a little later than usual (around 10:45 am) and had to park further back that we've ever had to park before. Although very crowded, all the lines moved quickly with the exception of the beef noodle soup line and fried custard line. You can expect to stand in the soup line better than 25 minutes if you don't get there BEFORE the vendors open @ 10:30 am.


THINGS TO REMEMBER

* BRUNCH is SUNDAY ONLY
* GET HERE EARLY!!! It will help you avoid being way at the back of the lines, help you secure a better parking space and you won't have to search for an available table to sit down and eat your meal. 
* Many of the monks will not hold a conversation with you NOR will they take a picture with you, but they will direct you to a leader who'd be happy to do both. 
* Be respectful of the temple and other buildings occupied by the monks. THIS IS A PLACE OF WORSHIP and anyone coming here, no matter your religious beliefs, should honor their ways. SHOES OFF in the temple and no loud speaking or vulgar speech. 
* Sometimes when it is really cold outside or raining they have an area behind the vendors that is covered and has additional seating. The restrooms are also located there. 
* This is an outdoor facility with communal tables. Other than the covered areas provided, you WILL be subject to temperatures and the wind of the day, so dress accordingly.


FINAL THOUGHTS

If you've never been to Wat Mongkolratanaram of Florida, you are missing out on a real treat! Make plans to stuff your face in this place soon!

T2a-HOjI_zUXj_gxDZGS6w,VHWCzIZXpWPyeFe2lkIutQ,5,56,"I really enjoy adaptive reuse of old buildings that bring old and new sensibilities to the fore. When done well, they are both attractive and useful in ways unforeseen when the structure was first constructed, and bring new uses into old packages, calling the imagination of the new occupant forward in wonderment. The Johnson Hall Coffee House is a great example. It offers a shop unimagined in 1890 when it was build, yet as redesigned, it provides a functioning java house that could have existed at that time, but has emerged due to the evolving cultural affections of our modern day. It looks old, but isn't. 

It is a  warm, light and airy high ceilinged first floor retail outlet for excellent coffee products and breakfast, brunch and lunch options. Although limited by the kitchen equipment available to prepare meals, it still provides enough variety to make a stop very worthwhile. I loved the large windows, dropped period lighting, white ceramic tile, wood plank floors, and the friendliness of the staff. 

I ordered an egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on croissant, with mug o' joe. It came in at about $8, and while ordering was at the counter in back, the servers brought the sandwich to my table. They would be wise to advertise the coffee roaster more dominantly both in the store and online, as I am sure I was not the only one curious about who produced the quality beans. The croissant was not quite French boulangerie, but still large and tasty enough to be satisfying. 

Still, the atmosphere here is the star of the show. It is a great place for both solitary and collective pleasures.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c18f54dc13e8c0dde30""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, Coffee & Tea, Food"",""business_id"":""VHWCzIZXpWPyeFe2lkIutQ"",""name"":""Johnson Hall Coffee House""}]"

Prices are reasonable and the food is always on point. They offer a wide variety of delicious meals to choose from. My usual go to is the two item combo with a crispy chicken taco and enchilada. I finally tried the mole enchilada and I think it's my new favorite here! The sauce is semi-sweet and mildly spicy filled with grilled chicken and cheese. I'm not one to finish my meals but it was so good I cleaned my plate. I also recommend the ceviche, it's made with fresh halibut and it's perfect on a hot day. 

My girlfriend let me sample her Camarones Guajillo and the shrimp was cooked perfectly! I loved the buttery, sweet & semi-spicy sauce it was marinated in. 

Free chips are served here and they have a great salsa bar. 

Beverages: They serve soda, horchata, beer, and wine.

Atmosphere - 4 stars
Food - 5 stars
Service - 5 stars

Background - Time for lunch and stuck away from the house.  I do love my Triple D, Dinners, Drive in and Dives, restaurants and shockingly never been here before. 

Atmosphere - First time to restaurant and clearly set up for the COVID era we live in now.  Only two tables be used.  Pretty basic but what you need from a BBQ joint.

Food
Lunch - I had the Carolina Style Pulled Pork, which came with two sides.  I went with the hushpuppies and house pickles.  Oh my so many pickles as you get a few on the side with the meal too, along with cornbread.  I wish I had ordered a double of hushpuppies.  I picked the Carolina mustard sauce which was served in a tiny little cup but was the perfect amount for a quarter pound of that delicious pork.  Mustard and pork are made for each other.  The pork was a little dry without the sauce, I had to try a little without the sauce.

My wife's lunch - She had the St. Louis style ribs with moonshine bbq sauce.  Her sauce container was much larger of the 5 ribs she ordered.  The sauce was a little sweet which I expected from moonshine.  I am a fan of St. Louis ribs because of the Sparks ribfest and these did not disappoint.  She had a side of coleslaw which reminded us of KFC's when we were kids. 

Service - Ordering online is simple, no special app needed just a web browser.  Just do not forget to add the meal to the basket.  I did that the first time.  Like I said earlier that I wish I could have ordered double hushpuppies but you use a check box to indicate your choices for your two sides.  An extra line is not added when you make your selection, if you wanted the same side twice.  Once your order is submitted it gives you a time when it will ready for pick up.  They actually texted me when it was ready.  The only drawback there was a guy ordering his lunch and took forever for him to complete his order, he could not decide.  But cannot blame the business for that.

Future - Yes please.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c18f54dc13e8c0dde8c""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Barbeque, Soul Food, Southern"",""business_id"":""3ucn3_cDf1WV0DsFgoTfyQ"",""name"":""Carolina Kitchen & Barbeque""}]"

Background - My friend invited me to a basketball game Lawlor Event Center.  It is easier to eat near campus and thought this would be a good choice.

Atmosphere - Located on north side of campus, sharing the building with Cane's.  It is a very new building.  The colors inside pop with the self-advertising.   Seating is typically fast food.  Small tables with seats.

Food
  Dinner - A great variety of sandwiches to choose from.  I ordered from the Go Crazy section of the menu, which is a little higher in price.  They do have happy hour prices for students from 2 - 5pm for $7, Monday through Friday.  I had the Matt Cain with their World Famous Dutch bread.  I do not know about world famous but is was dang tasty.  I love Roast Beef subs so the Matt Cain caught my eye, which also included Beef Salami, Turkey, with Godfather sauce, which when I read that sauces name I heard in good fellas voice, then finished off with provolone.  Yeah the sandwich was on the expensive side but they do not slack on any of the ingredients.  To me it was worth every bite.

Service - Pretty basic but that is all you need.  You order at the register, they ask if you about the other items on the sub.  When they are done making your sub they call your name.   The wait for the sub is not bad considering how much they put into it.

Armature Works is not a new concept in modern day living, but it IS one of the most well executed that I've ever seen. 

It is basically a mall for restaurants, like a food court on steroids without all the anchor stores like Macy's, Dillard's, JC Penney, etc. Seems that many cities have began to adopt this urban modernization. Here in metro Atlanta we have three similar places: Ponce City Market and Krog Street Market as well as the much older and less trendy Sweet Aurburn Market. All of which have multiple restaurants with a few kitschy shops peppered in.  


[ HISTORY ]

This is all part of Tampa's revitalization project going on all along the Hillsboro River. It seemingly began with the creation of a Riverwalk near Curtis Hixon Park in 1976. Here the city installed wooden planks that were replaced in 1989 with granite pavers. By 2010 many new city parks, hotels and other business began to shape and revitalize the riverfront. Curtis Hixon was upgraded to a lovely water font park and by 2014, Water Works Park was completed further upstream. Soon after the gorgeous restaurant known as Uelele opened near Water Works Park with a beautiful view of the Hillsborough River right at a bend, allowing views both up & downstream. It is here where the story of Armature Works begins. 

It was once the storage and maintenance facility for Tampa Electric's (TECO) streetcars and simple known as THE BARN. Bet ya didn't know Tampa once upon a time had street cars like the ones still found in New Orleans did ya? Developers Chas Bruck and Adam Harden of SoHo Capital have purposefully kept the feel of Armature Works authentic by allowing the original exposed brick walls, skylights, windows and doors to remain. They even reused the old roof as hardwood flooring throughout this 73,000 square foot mixed-use space.


[ TAMPA'S NEWEST HOT SPOT ] 

Armature Works is best described as a place where food lovers can gather in a super trendy and comfy foodie utopia. A gallery of restaurants serving everything from ramen and Cuban sandwiches to BBQ, pizza and wine with brie. You can even pamper your taste buds with a $78 Tomahawk Ribeye (32oz) found @ Steelbach.

There are plenty of seating areas both inside and out. Some are very intimate while others are communal. There is a central exterior atrium known as 'The Courtyard' with more seating as well as a riverfront lawn complete with giant checkerboards and synthetic grass. 

Those of you looking for a wedding or event venue will find plenty.
Four spaces known as the Theater, The Gathering, the Social Hall and the Social Room are available for rent as well as TWO Rooftop Gardens. If all that weren't enough there is a place called SHOW & TELL, a full demonstration kitchen & entertainment workshop designed to host a variety of events. This place is insanely well done!!!


[ FOODS TO TRY ]

Cubano @ Hemingway's
Cheeseburger Empanada @ Empamamas
Chicken Paitan Ramen @ Ichicoro Imoto
Korean Philly @ BNB


[ ENTERTAINMENT ] 

On the 2nd Wednesday of every month from 6:00pm - 9:00pm a 'Night Market' will feature a rotating cast of artisanal artists and makers selling handmade goods, jewelry, art, wood-work, gifts, etc. A free family-friendly event featuring live music. 


[ FINAL THOUGHTS ]

Armature Works makes me feel happy and privileged to be alive in this era of human development. It combines so much of what I love: Nature, water, outdoor beauty, historic significance, a welcoming décor, clever & creative uses of materials/items, and a AMAZING variety of foods all while cultivating a family-friendly community environment. All it need now is a covered bridge and my own personal view of heaven would be complete.

7edDFDu29KzpET2XtHWtfg,6yGZ9RMMcW2-sKmnbIWbmw,5,67,"4.5 stars on its way to 5 BIG stars! Variety, recipes, prices, & service will see to it! This new rising star replaces the former Heritage American Bistro that had opened for a brief period (to excellent reviews). Unfortunately for the bistro & its charming owners, the timing of its conception coincided w/ the onset of Covid & Covid restrictions. American Heritage closed its doors for Tampa Taco Co. to be born. (This Mexican restaurant is open all days but Tuesdays & Thursdays.) 

Do NOT be misled by the business name. This establishment is SO MUCH MORE than a standard taco eatery. Appetizers include Chips & Guac, Chips & Queso, Mashed Potato Tacos, Elotes, Nachos, Quesadillas, Sopes, & Flautas. Available daily entrees offered are *Tacos ($2.75), Burritos ($8.50), Tortas ($8), Chimichangas ($9.50), & Tostadas ($3.50). The WEEKEND BRUNCH entrees are as follows: Chilaquiles, Huevos Rancheros, Breakfast Burito & Breakfast Tacos, Pancakes (varies depending upon the day), Biscuit & Gravy, & a Breakfast Bowl. (*Available taco varieties: fish, shrimp, veggie, pork, beef, & chicken)

The married owners/chefs, Aliana & Cesar (see pic), are worthy partners. Hailing from the Dominican Republic & Puerto Rico/Mexico, they met in culinary school @ Johnson & Whales in Miami. A protégé, Aliana's father owns Zacatacos (5 Mexican eateries) in Chicago, & has assisted in the transformation of Heritage American Bistro to Tampa Taco Co. Even Aliana's grandmother has had a hand in the makeover; you can thank her for the rice & sauces.

This clean restaurant offers many outside seats on the covered patio-- see pic. It's a perfect location for social distancing or for a dinner out w/ a favorite canine. 

The large chalk menu is readily visible on the back wall. It lists the daily offerings as well as the Saturday & Sunday brunch entrees. Prices are low for the quality & quality of food you'll receive. 

This talented couple is the epitome of the American dream, & one (like many) who are trying hard to survive the perils of 2020. I ordered three entrees to sample (& feed to my refrigerator shelves:). 

The Tres Leches Pancakes (recommended by wonderfully friendly Chris) was my favorite entree of the day. For $7.00, I was treated to a large stack of deliciously flavorful & fluffy buttermilk pancakes topped w/ a generous heaping of whipped topping. The $8 Breakfast Burito was quite good; for me, it would have been even better if a sauce had accompanied it. And the creative & a little spicy Chilaquiles @ $9 was the most interesting dish; I loved the thick cheese that topped it & I enjoyed the crunch of the tortillas that served as its base. I like different, & it was something I've never found at another Mexican restaurant. 

I will definitely return to try a basic taco, although I'm unsure if this talented culinary duo can produce just ""basic."" They simply have too much talent, potential, & ambition. Please don't take my word for it-- drive over to check out this wonderful addition to Lutz/Land 'O Lakes & the surrounding areas. 

Just a short drive from North Tampa & Wesley Chapel, your palate & wallet will have no regrets. Mine definitely didn't!

DHAgMy_6ly7bNDENfnMWxQ,CYSPKiVdoPX3erovujnE9Q,5,55,"Harp & Crown is like two different restaurants. The weekend brunch buffet (offered Saturdays & Sundays) has a whole different vibe than the ""other"" (same place) sit -down restaurant. If you're wondering (and I was) the weekend brunch options are basically the same on both Saturdays and Sundays (I asked). But from what I understand, the flavors of the scones and quiches change periodically and I imagine some of the seasonal offerings may change as well. There wasn't that much that was seasonal so it's probably fairly consistent.

Food/drink cont'd.
I really enjoyed the all you can eat brunch as a whole and though I didn't try every single item, I certainly enjoyed what I tried. My favorite items were the roast prime rib and the fried potatoes. If there had been a roasted vegetable and a popover, it would have been a classic ""Sunday Roast."" I was hoping they'd have a Caesar salad option, but not all wishes come true. None the less, the offerings were still very, very good- in fact it was one of the best brunch buffets I've ever attended, including the one at Lacroix! 
The pot de creme chocolate was delicious, especially with the fresh berries. I also enjoyed the smoked salmon/bagel option. 

We also ordered a bottle of sparkling wine to mix with the OJ and GFJ options included with the brunch which also included iced or hot coffee or iced or hot tea(unlimited). All of this was $28/person. The bottle of sparkling wine was $44. For Center City, these prices are great!

And unlike a lot of the all you can eat places, the quality of the food was excellent. I usually know afterward by how thirsty I am. And since I'm not thirsty at all, I think that means the food wasn't full of preservatives and other cheap flavor enhancers to make up for quality. I thought the smoked salmon was not at all over the top salty which made it extra yummy. I took lots of photos. There was something for everyone on that brunch buffet and I recommend it to everyone who likes to eat. 

Re. Photos, I didn't capture everything served on the brunch menu. So there will be a few fun surprises when it's your turn to experience H&C weekend brunch!

Service:
One of the highlights of the day was the gentleman who served the prime rib and also made the waffles. I should have asked him his name! He was outstanding! With a great personality, he hand sliced with perfection! He was also very nice and professional and I could tell he took pride in his work! He really enjoyed it and when you feel that, it makes the whole experience that much better! He's a keeper!!! I see great things for his future!

Adam our server was terrific and there was plenty of support staff to grab our empty plates. I noticed they got pretty aggressive near the end and not as attentive at the beginning which felt not so great; especially since we still had half of a bottle of wine to drink when they started hanging about us. So it felt a bit presumptive. If they really wanted us to go, perhaps they should have refilled our glasses with the wine instead of attempting to snatch our plates away before we were finished. That would have been a more diplomatic approach and its not easy for everyone to pour their own wine. 

In spite of that one not so fun issue, it was a great  experience and again I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys brunch or just enjoys food.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e2df5""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Active Life, Nightlife, Bars, American (Traditional), Bowling, Restaurants, American (New), Gastropubs"",""business_id"":""CYSPKiVdoPX3erovujnE9Q"",""name"":""Harp & Crown""}]"

Mind you, this isn't a place that you can just walk into and grab a doughnut. This is a pop-up as of now but I'm hoping they find a permanent location in the near future. I know they would do very well here. They accept online pre-orders on Thursdays beginning at noon. Check out their website to order at: 
https://www.mordoughnuts.com/ 
Pick-up is on Saturday & Sunday and you can choose the time slot they offer. You get 4 Mochi doughnuts for only $12! I thought that was a great deal for what you get. 

Picking up my order was easy. There was a sign on the sidewalk pointing me into the driveway and into the parking lot. So curbside pick-up is the only way to get these right now. Don't forget to wear a mask! 

Each week 4 different flavors are offered. My order consisted of Guava, Black Sesame, Milk & Cereal, and Matcha Wonderland. The Guava was my favorite but then again I'm a fan of all things Guava. The black sesame had a slight smoky, nutty flavor. Milk & Cereal was sweet, creamy and totally reminded me of eating an actual bowl of cereal. The Matcha Wonderland reminded me of drinking matcha tea but the flavor was very subtle. 

I couldn't get over the texture of these! Definitely not your average doughnut. These were very light and chewy just like a Mochi. It was suggested that if we didn't eat them right away to leave the box slightly ajar so they kept their texture. But we ate them right away so all was good. 

It was fun trying each flavor with my son. We cut each one in half and reviewed them by taste in the car lol. Overall kid and mama approved! I can't wait to see what other flavors they offer.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0df5ff""},""stars"":""5"",""categories"":""Pop-Up Restaurants, Restaurants, Food, Donuts"",""business_id"":""12Gc4OFQ-WAW0fAk2hRZuQ"",""name"":""Kin Bakeshop""}]"
-bO3LNibnUfUGta8EWtJXw,XuQ5ekbJ9eRUX06JTqJHaQ,5,111,"There are over 100 restaurants to eat at in downtown St. Petersburg. Fortunately my friend had a knack for finding the best places. Actually everyone we talked to in St. Petersburg loves this restaurant. Florida Trend magazine named them ""Best New Restaurant in Florida."" They have  this location in St. Pete and one in South Tampa. After touring the Dali Museum we headed over for lunch. 

The Mill has been open for seven years.. Their menu was created by Tampa Bay native chef Ted Dorsey, formerly of Castille Restaurant at Hotel Zamora. Chef Dorsey describes the menu as ""rustic Americana with a Southern touch and a French Creole twist."" The Mill took over over the location of the former Jo Jo's Citta, a longtime Italian restaurant. Interior designer Amanda McMahon was hired to design The Mill. Many of the items in the restaurant were purchased at a vintage market. The restaurant has an industrial steam punk vibe. The 3D wall murals by renowned local artist Istavan Torok. There are gears on the wall and the servers wear the kinds of aprons welders would wear. The sink in the bathroom is a tiny vintage bathtub. At The Mill they offer both indoor and outdoor dining. We arrived on Valentines Day and they were packed. We had the choice of waiting an hour for a table or finding a space at the bar and it just so happened that there were two seats waiting for us. It must have been fate.

The Mill is well known for their watermelon bruschetta. Our hotel, the Avalon actually had free coupons for this menu item. If only we had known, oh well. I started off with a refreshing mimosa while we looked over the menu. They serve inventive cocktails, beer, and wine. The brunch menu had sliders, salads, and small and big plates. We decided to share the spreads and breads ($9.50) that came with three dips along with bread and chips. My favorite was the caramelized French onion but the pimento cheese and the roasted red pepper honey hummus were also very good and I didn't even think I liked hummus. My favorite dipper was their homemade potato chips. For lunch my friend I both ordered the Southern Bell Salad ($7.50). The salad had romaine, red onions, sage derby, peppadews, dried apricots, southern fried chicken, and honeycup vinaigrette. This salad was amazing. The chicken was so hot and crunchy. I loved when I got a bite of it with that fantastic sage derby cheese. Hands down the best salad I've had in a long time.

Our server was David. He was a super nice guy but we had to wait a long time for service. Part of the problem was the cocktails that he was making took a long time. He was also slammed because of the holiday. Another part of the problem was that every 10 minutes or so he had to jump up on top of the bar to fix something that was making it rain water down onto the bar. He was part bartender, part maintenance man. I think they finally got it fixed as we were leaving. Normally I don't mind lingering over a meal but we had a packed day ahead of us and we wanted to get to several other places. A nice touch while we were eating was when the manager went around and gave all of the ladies a carnation for Valentines Day. I am glad I got a chance to dine at The Mill. Next time I would make a reservation.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e299d""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Breakfast & Brunch, American (New), Bars, Lounges, Restaurants, Nightlife"",""business_id"":""XuQ5ekbJ9eRUX06JTqJHaQ"",""name"":""The Mill Restaurant""}]"

THE SCENE
I started a talk thread in Tampa about 1 month before my visit asking the natives of the city to give me their favorite restaurant recommendations. The Tampa community was gracious and overwhelmed me with options. One suggestion in particular caught my eye (thank you Coty S). After checking the reviews and pics, it was clear this place is a must. After all, how often could you ever say you ate on the grounds of a Buddhist Temple with real live monks walking around. 

We decided to meet a few yelpers here that would definitely appreciate the quirky and unusual setting. I've shared compliments with Brian S from Rhode Island often, but we've never met in person before today. You may know him from his many lighthouse, public parks and library reviews. He is also one of only a few yelpers worldwide with over 65,000 compliments (which makes him sort of yelp famous). He, along with the Scruffy Tourist that appears in so many of his pics spent the day with us here and also at Fort DeSoto afterwards. It was a fabulous day filled with good food and good company... even though it was so cold outside that I saw a politician with his hands in his OWN pockets.

**********
 
HOW IT WORKS HERE
First, I was advised to be here by 10:30am on Sunday morning, but it would actually have been better to be here by 10am and wait for the different businesses to open. Some of the lines get REALLY long, especially for the pho soup.
  
The setup is mostly outdoors, so take that into consideration when planning your visit. It was really cold today and although the vending areas were covered, the plastic shielded the wind but not the temps. There is a large enclosed barn-like eating area, but most areas for eating are picnic tables surrounding the building. 

TIP - Each vendor has their own line, so it might be wise to split up if you are with a group and have each person go different vendors to order.

**********

THE FOOD
* I enjoyed fried chicken wings at a place specializing in curry chicken that was freakin' incredible! I can't tell you the name of the place to save my life, but it was the only place I saw serving fried chicken wings. Follow your nose and you'll find this vendor!

* MY FIRST PHO experience turns out not to be pho at all :-(   Another yelper informed me it was just beef noodle soup, but Pho or not it was well worth the wait and so delicious! My only regret is that I 
A) should have got the larger noodles instead of the angel hair ones and 
B) If I had known I would have requested no cilantro. I hate cilantro! Otherwise this noodle soup was amazeballs.

* Curry Pumpkin Chicken near the noodle soup vendor was incredible. All kinds of moaning was going on as we sampled food from 5 different vendors (probably a dozen more that we missed). I was truly as happy as a tornado in a trailer park!

* The fried banana's and fried sweet potatoes HOT out of the frier were delicious. You haven't had anything until you've had these! You get a HUGE bag for just $5. Matter of fact, most everything here was $5 and the portions were Ginormous. The only exception were the egg rolls (located between the soup and curry pumpkin chicken vendor). They were $1 each and they were so good we ordered a dozen.

**********

THE VERDICT
I lost my mind at Wat Mongkolratanaram and I need to go back as soon as possible to find it (lol).  I plan to come here EVERY SUNDAY I'm in the Tampa area visiting to indulge myself in the best food experience ever created. This place is amazing and I am forever grateful to the Tampa yelp community for suggesting it!!!!    

Nothing fancy, nothing pretentious, just good food, great prices in a festive atmosphere where total strangers come together like old friends. This is by far my favorite yelp find of the year 2012.

Here's the rundown on the Italian Beef-this juicy monster of a sandwich, known as ""Chicago's #1 Beef"" is about the size of an average man's head, and there is absolutely no shame in devouring every last bite. I suggest adding some zesty giardiniera & melted Mozzarella cheese...or in Portillo's terms....""hot with mozz"". The Hot Dog with ""Everything"" includes yellow mustard, neon green relish, celery salt, freshly chopped onions, sliced red ripened tomatoes, a hefty kosher pickle spear and hot sport peppers piled high into a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun.

birqhk03AYjec-mDAk9sEA,EUjrGTbA69NUnXifTBE43w,5,57,"It's my first time eating at the Ahtti Korean Munchies food truck and I can't wait for them to come back so I can explore everything on their menu. None of the guests today seem to have that ""munchies"" in the marijuana sense of the word, but we're in front of a Morgan Stanley financial services building, so it's pretty buttoned up. :) 

First thing I liked: They are FAST. I made it through the line and had my food in under 5 minutes. You'd think every food truck would be like that, but I waited 25 minutes for a 10-inch pizza in the same spot yesterday.  

And the food ... yum! It didn't hurt that both items I ordered had fried chicken in 'em.  

One recommendation for Ahtti: More soda selection. I'm still on a sugar high from that Pepsi I drank (they had water, Pepsi, and Sprite ... I saw nothing else). But a small quibble. Now back to the good stuff!

First, I got some Mandoo (Korean dumplings): Soft, just doughy enough, a nice light brown on it, not too hot, and a perfect mix of veggies and fried chicken bits. 

Then my main course: Holy Moly Tacos. I chose fried chicken as my meat, and the tortillas were filled with said meat, along with veggies, lettuce, and a sweet and savory mix of their secret sauces.  Great taste in every bite ... it made me long for more.

Completely exciting, different, superbly executed non-Americanized Middle Eastern Food.

Swooping into the city of Brotherly Love and getting a strong recommendation to visit Lips and I curiously  reached Zahav almost on time. 
I won't go into the flowery description. Just that this was very enjoyed.
We were greeted warmly at the door. I observed this wasn't just because of possibly being recognized. The staff goes out of their way to work as a team with great sincerity. The place was packed, however the noise level was not a factor.

Listing the Plates:

Hummus with garlic and olive Oil. Excellent, light with the most delectable Israeli Bread.
Yemenite brisket, onions, fresh chickpeas A bit salty, fantastic Brisket Flavor, served HOT! 
Fried salt cod, tasty fresh and moist
Sweetbreads, Too much Breading. Dissapointing
Grilled duck hearts, I know what your thinking, Try this, I have never had this before however this was a treat. The Muscle itself absorbs whatever sauce its cooked with,
Crispy lamb's tongue, good a bit dry, basically tastes like a Lamb Chop.
Merguez ground lamb,Strong Lamb Taste, tender and moist
Hanger steak, Excellent, moist, cook a tad less than Mid Rare.

Dessert was ok, a bit skimpy, coffee could have been served hotter.

Service was close to perfection, well trained, knowledgeable.

AGzDVNk33hdpRdtcu-r71w,j8feOxyJqlIJWOi8su2qzw,5,61,"Serial Grillers is the real deal! After seeing the name pop up on Food Network, Forbes, and the Cooking Channel, I could not miss the opportunity to visit the infamous restaurant while visiting Tucson. Serial Grillers came about from two brothers who had the idea of doing something a little different with their favorite foods, which includes cheesesteaks, calzones and pizza. And different is definitely what they did. The restaurant is a little hole in the wall with no flashy signage. Upon walking in, the medium sized dining area has some cool wall art and a self serve soda station. After checking out the menu and consulting with the employees, I decided on the Hannibal cheesesteak. 

The Hannibal cheesesteak was delivered about ten minutes after ordering and it was worth the wait. Topped with ribeye, grilled onions, hot cherry peppers, sweet peppers, tomatoes, pickles and white american cheese, this sandwich was a sight for sore eyes. Although it sounds super spicy, it was actually the perfect amount of spicy and savory. The ribeye was tender and juicy, the hot cherry peppers and sweet peppers balanced one another out perfectly the the cheese was just the right amount. Each sandwich does come with either a choice of potato salad or coleslaw. I opted for the potato salad which was served in a little cup of starchy goodness. It was a little salty for my taste, but still super flavorful. 

If you are looking for a quick, tasty and affordable meal, this is the place for you. The cheesesteak was perfectly prepared, perfectly portioned and perfectly seasoned. Though I wish they opened one of these in LA, I fear that it would not be the same. Visiting Serial Grillers is a nice treat when visiting the area. The restaurant offers table service; you order your food at the register and take a number to your table where the food is delivered to you. There is free parking available for the restaurant (which is always a plus).

The restaurant was only 5.5 miles from our stay at The Sands Regency.

Got here a little after the lunch rush at 1:30p so the place was not very busy. After looking through the menu we decided to have Sizzling Rice Soup [$11.99], Fried Prawns (4 pcs) [$8.59], Salt & Pepper Spare Ribs [$12.99], and BBQ Pork fried rice [$12.99]. The dishes were tasty and delicious! Loved everything we ordered. The fried prawns were huge lightly crisped batter fried until golden brown... one of life's simplest pleasures! It came with homemade sweet sour sauce. Addicting! Not all fried rice are created equal but I loved their fried rice! Plenty of pork and other ingredients! The sizzling rice soup was perfect for the chill weather... yummy comfort food!

If you are familiar wiith Los Agaves this place is operated by the same great team and the newest addition in restaurants by Carlos Luna. I had expected it to be jam packed when we arrived but luckily we were able to get seats at the beautiful bar area right away. It's always fun sitting at the bar socializing with the bartender. Sean was great and he created some awesome hand crafted cocktails! 

I started with the Margarita Picante which was perfectly made! You have the choice of fresno mezcal or serrano tequila. I went with the serrano tequila and really enjoyed it. This drink is made with agave nectar, lime, and has a rim with chipotle salt. 

My second drink of choice was La Paloma Clasica and again stuck with the tequila but you do have the option of mezcal as well. If you are a fan of grapefruit order this! It was very light and refreshing and didn't have a bitter taste as grapefruit can be.

As for the food I decided on the pulpo tacos. The serving presentation was great all around but once I took that first bite I was let down by the overcooked octopus. It was rubbery, chewy, and the flavor was lacking. I debated a good while on sending it back since I don't like to insult the cooks but I couldn't just waste my meal so I sent it back and management was kind and gracious enough to accept it and thanked me for letting them know. Hence the five stars!

Meal Tip: If you are not satisfied with your food please don't hesitate to let them know! They are all about making the customer happy.

I was able to replace my meal and decided to stick with something I know and went with the Mole Poblano. I've had the mole at Los Agaves and knew it wouldn't let me down. This meal includes a grilled butterflied chicken breast served over their delicious mole poblano, and their signature pyramid shaped Mexican rice and black beans in the cute little tostada shell.

The Empanadas de Camaron is a must try! These were perfectly cooked and the filling of shrimp and cheese melted in my mouth. A great appetizer to start with. My friend also ordered the Ceviche Verde which she let me try and it was just as good. The fish was tender and the green sauce (cilantro basil) was very flavorful.

How does this place compare to Los Agaves? I would say it has the same great taste and flavors but with a twist. Most of the choices on the menu do look familiar but they are different and the choices of seafood are expanded. 

Overall I'm excited we have a new restaurant that's clearly here to stay. The location is within walking distance from the Funk Zone and a few blocks from our beautiful beach.

Here, excellence isn't just about food, but really about the entire experience from the moment you walk in the door until you walk out.  The servers attend to you with Southern grace, and every detail of your seating is to create that special ambiance and romance.

I will say that despite their best efforts, there were flaws.  For one, drinks took an eternity to come, and luckily arrived just before the first course.  Our dessert and nightcap drinks also took more than a 1/2hr to come!  And moving on to the food and drinks, clearly some are better than others...

1. Tequila Mockingbird 2 $13 ""an original creation of Commanders... we liked this drink so much we named it twice. tequila and lemoncello combine to create a tart treat you so nice you'll order it twice"":  Refreshing and very tart.  Smooth.  Good tasting though not complex.  7/10

2. Kessler Riesling 6oz $11.50

3. Garlic Bread (complimentary):  Soaked in butter.  Did not skimp on the garlic, and there's tons of spices and cheese.  7/10

4. Cast Iron Seared Redfish Cake $13 ""blackened redfish cake with shaved winter vegetable salad, peppery argula & rum barrel hot sauce aioli"":  Resembles a high-end crab cake, but substituting fish.  Soft, yet many textures including julienned vegetables.  Creamy consistency, with some horseradish. 8/10

5. Turtle Soup $8.50 ""a Commander's classic finished tableside with dry sherry"":  Can't come here and not get this.  Just do it.  No, it is not amazing tasting.  The turtle is really dry for one.  Though, that sherry does add quite a bit of complexity.  Well, just gotta try it.  7/10

6. Caramelized Pumpkin Salad $9.50 ""Covey Rise Farm pumpkins with petite greens, Belgian endive, pecan tuile, brandy soaked grapes with artisan cheese and Satsuma-cane syrup vinaigrette"":  Delicious!  Crisp vegetables against sweet pumpkin and fruit.  Love all the sweet crispy things on top too!  10/10

7. Pecan Crusted Gulf Fish $39 ""a Commander's Palace classic with crushed corn cream, spiced pecans, petite herbs and prosecco poached Louisiana blue crab"":  Well, I'd have to say, it's a ton better than I was expecting.  Often nut crusted fish just ends up with a dry and hard breading.  But in this case, they kept the pecans light, and was not offensive.  The sauce is a bit sweet and very rich.  The fish flesh was pretty good, but was just a tad tough and could stand to be cooked less.  8/10

8. South Louisiana Seafood Stew $36 ""a rich seafood stew of Gulf fish, poached local oysters, wild white shrimp, a popcorn rice boudin cake, with a charred tomato-chili broth and roasted trinity garnish"":  Well, I kinda object to the name--this wasn't a ""stew"" at all.  I mean, I guess they can say the sauce is a stew.  Anyway, the fish is savory with a crisp skin.  Some flavorful mysteries in there too.  Loved how perfectly the oysters were cooked, nearly raw but just enough, and ultra tender.  The oysters paired really well with the rest of the dish.  6/10

9. Sweet Potato Milk Punch $9.50 ""we combine milk and vanilla to a perfect balance of creamy goodness. next, house-made spiced rum spiked with sweet potato is the kick you won't want to miss"":  AWFUL.  Cannot taste of that sweet potato whatsoever.  Tastes pretty much like sugar and milk mixed with alcohol.  Perhaps a super watered-down egg nog?  2/10

10. Limoncello $5

11. Lally's Praline Parfait $8.50 ""hand-crafted vanilla ice cream layered in an old fashioned parfait glass with candied pecans and sticky praline syrup, Lally Brennan's favorite dessert"":  OH GOD... perhaps best sundae I've EVER had!?  So luscious.  That house-made ice cream is decadently luxurious, and paired with the pralines... heavenly!  10/10

12. Commander's Bread Pudding Souffle $9.50 ""all the richness of Creole bread pudding whipped up into a light souffle, finished tableside with warm whiskey cream"":  Hmm, this one is tough.  It's not really a ""souffle.""  More like bread pudding with meringue on top.  Really mushy bread pudding.  My gf didn't like it.  But personally it worked for me.  It was served really hot, and the sauce clearly had plenty of alcohol.  Most bread puddings are too... bready.  But I think this dessert made good use of the bread.  8/10

So, there were mishaps, and not everything was the best example of cooking.  But overall, it was a beautiful night at a very special restaurant.

5/5

qIWTF542DQ08zamCmyZIdQ,U3grYFIeu6RgAAQgdriHww,5,75,"After a Holiday traffic nightmare on the road, we decided to just get off the 101 rest and wait out the craziness. Brophy Bros. is a Santa Barbara landmark and usually stop in when we are in the area. They open at 11 am and is constantly packed with locals and tourists. The main dinning room / bar is not large and they do have outside seating on the terrace with a bar downstairs too. Brophy Bros. is a seafood raw bar restaurant and IMO has the best clam chowder in Santa Barbara. Its chunky with tons of chopped clams. On our recent visit we ordered the following:

Seafood combo comes with ceviche, shrimp, oysters and clams
Little Neck clams on the half shell
Fried Calamari
A big bowl of the clam chowder.

The raw clams and oysters were very fresh and the hot fried calamari was excellent. The ceviche was however hard to eat spread out on the iced seafood combo plate. 

The restaurant is loud and high energy. There is parking spaces around the restaurant but they are hard to come by. So there is a large City parking lot right next to the center.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e28b3""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Cocktail Bars, Fish & Chips, Nightlife, Seafood, Restaurants, Bars"",""business_id"":""U3grYFIeu6RgAAQgdriHww"",""name"":""Brophy Bros - Santa Barbara""}]"
lRq5TPMPIjlxkHfvgfGMyg,j5siJykDq7GWzgSdpOjhdw,5,108,"My dearest Anna - It is with immense pleasure that I have the opportunity to write to you once again. As you know, one score and fifteen years hath passed since we were tasked with locating and mapping out the Nation's finest burger establishments. The journey has been long and arduous to say the least. Our current expedition started late last spring out west in California Territory and took us through the Republic of Texas by mid summer before finally arriving here in Confederate Territory last fall. There was no shortage of spectacular and noteworthy finds along the trail. It was however here, in the outpost of Nashville (Cumberland River Valley), that our eyes were awakened to a truly special establishment by name of Jack Brown's. It is our understanding that there is more than one location of Jack Brown's out here in this part of the country, but you'd never know by the atmosphere, hospitality and service we found here at this location. 

I cannot recall ever, a tougher time making a decision than here at Jack Brown's. Never have I seen a burger list where every one sounded so desirable. With much deliberation I went with the Cobra Kai. I suspected these Southerners were just confused as I've never seen cream cheese on a burger prior. Confused and lucky perhaps; I do not know, but the cream cheese is truly a magnificent touch. The cream cheese combined with jalapeños (a pepper brought up from Mexican Territory) and jalapeño jelly made for a burger that will not be soon forgotten. I cannot even begin to explain the abundance of flavor I witnessed. The beef, a USDA Prime 100% Wagyu sourced from Snake River Farms in Fort Boise (Oregon Territory), was absolutely remarkable. The quality of the beef makes an undeniable difference. From my seat, belied up to the bar, I watched as cookie masterfully prepared the beef on a flattop (undoubtedly smuggled down from the North). Each side of the burger was seared and specially seasoned before going under the steaming dish for final preparation. The bun was perfectly toasted while the toppings were all well appointed. The sight of this burger alone reassured my belief in this expedition. Dare I say that the flavors were mighty as the Mississippi. As with all of the burgers here, things got messy in a hurry, but no one seamed to mind. 

While here I also partook in a sampling they refer to as the Greg Brady. We are not sure who this Greg fellow is, but surely he must be a southern dignitary of sorts. The Greg Brady is topped with mac n' cheese and barbecue potato chips. Let me just say - Whoa nelly little momma!  I also had a sampling of The Ponch (possibly the moniker of one of their yellow-bellied Generals) a burger topped with a house-made guacamole (smashed and seasoned avocados from California Territory), applewood smoked bacon, white cheddar cheese and Sriracha mayo. Again, a burger that will absolutely delight your taste buds and leave you longing for more. 

While the burgers are the priority, it should be noted that I partook in a side offering of fries that should not be slept on. The fries are a Yukon Gold, crinkle cut variety that was fried to a perfect golden crisp with nary a soggy one among the bunch. They don't cheat you none on the portion size either. Then there's the fry sauce; different than any other I've encountered, I have no idea of how it is concocted (possibly mayo, ketchup, mustard and other spices) but will swear to you, it is heavenly. 

If it were possible, we'd just remain in camp here and eat Jack Brown's burgers night and day throughout the rest of winter. Unfortunately, we must continue on though. I have sent letters back to the President, bestowing a top recommendation for Jack Brown's Beer & Burger Joint. The Chief would be crazy to not immediately get down here and witness this one for himself. 

With new sense of untold vigor, the troops have been rallied once again and we are homeward ho. Baring any further orders from the President or trouble crossing Indian Territory, please expect me by the onset of spring. 

My thoughts, my prayers and all my love be upon you. 

Sincerely,

Col. Jarrod R., 7th Calvary Regiment","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1cf54dc13e8c0e23b8""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""American (Traditional), Nightlife, Food, Restaurants, Bars, Burgers, Beer, Wine & Spirits"",""business_id"":""j5siJykDq7GWzgSdpOjhdw"",""name"":""Jack Brown's Beer & Burger Joint""}]"
fKtb3o6_52VPssKbvyWptw,dclL14pr7OojCOKJ_ZbMbQ,5,56,"This weekend after a lovely brunch my Yelp pal Shannon S. took me in a walk to another neighborhood family business that has over 120 years of New Orleans goodness. 

This place is a wonderful Sicilian bakery that was originally established in 1905 in the French Quarter by Angelo Brocato, Sr. The local Italian residents Quarter would come early every morning with their warm bread to dip in Angelo's freshly-made granita al limone for breakfast. (lemon ice) They still make their famous lemon ice today and have been in their current, N Carrollton Ave location, since the 80's. I've heard that they have an outlet at the airport too. 

So when you walk in you immediately get the sense of stroking back in time, it's set up like an old apothecary from years gone by. The smells, well you gotta be there, oh my. They are well known for everything they make, it's authentic and just done right. Their gelato, ice creams, cakes, cappuccino and if course lemon ice are legendary and I am already looking forward to my next visit. 

I had a cannoli, almond biscotti and couple if cookies and can attest to the amazing flavors that they put into the authentic Sicilian delicious sweets. I'm a cannoli lover and I can honestly say that theirs is perfect, I'm talking cannoli heaven! 

Their expresso machine is iconic and Shannon tells a funny story about the annual machine cleaning when people are Jonsing for their expresso for a week or so LOL

You can find their goodies all around the greater Nawlins area in local markets and grocery stores that carry their pre-packed ices and gelato, cannolis and biscotti! yum!

Read about their rich history and tradition and resilience after hurricane Katrina when their shop was under 5' of water:

My friend and I requested their terrace seating so it was a little bit of a wait, but not as long as some of the other restaurants we went to this trip. Anyways, their terrace is a great place to take photos from that really highlight the NOLA vibes. My friend was a little nervous because the terrace didn't exactly seem the most steady/ sturdy, but it was an experience nevertheless (take that how you will)! 

Anyways, our server was great. He was really honest when we were asking for recommendations and for him to basically choose for us, which I greatly appreciated. I ordered the blackened chicken sandwich with a side of hush puppies, and for dessert I had the brownie a la mode.

ch2KEagZ6yKnRFvq-LG8qA,pKWCgqQkKpumlgmbSLYX6Q,5,85,"A perfect place to be on Thank You Thursday! Seldom does this non-sandwich person love a shop whose speciality is sandwiches & the like, but Moody Judy's is NOT your ordinary shop. Once you enter through the glass doorway, you'll feel as though you're stepping back in time. 

Not only is Moody Judy not ""moody,"" but this New York dimpled native is downright friendly & ever so sweet. Even had she not referred to me as ""adorable,"" ""cute,"" & then stated that I look much younger than my age, her 2.5-year-old shoppe would easily earn 5 stars. I set my bias aside:)

Moody Judy's menu includes 5 salads, MANY sandwiches (see menu pic), 11 hotdog varieties, & 6 sides. There's even a ""Secret Menu"" on the counter that offers up 13 additional dogs! 

I counted twenty-six flavors of ice-cream, along w/ a no sugar added variety! Yes, 26! (The menu notes 30 flavors, including VEGAN & dairy free.) The Banana Pudding shake I chose was AMAZING! I would swear someone stole my personal banana pudding recipe! The bits of gramcracker that snuck into my straw upon each slurp were appreciated. Did I say TWENTY-SIX flavors???? WoW. And although the ice-cream is not made on site, that does not negate the phenomenal creamy texture & delicious flavors. Feel free to taste test. 

Owner Judy recommends the Cuban Sandwich while her high school-aged son Christopher prefers the Cheesesteak. I opted for a Tuna Melt, & was impressed that the tuna salad is made to order; I could have had more or less onion & celery (or none). The delicious pressed bread that sandwiched my tuna salad was made at a Tampa bakery. I love that it's another local business! 

BREAKFAST is served ALL DAY; there are 17 offerings! And there are 5 Kids' Meals available. Family meals, not on the menu, are also available for purchase & will cost you $30+. Phone for more info. There's a wall sign that lists the daily specials. 

The only thing I didn't find here that would have been the cherry atop the ice-cream sundae of life (so to speak) was a dill pickle spear. I would have loved to have been served one w/ my sandwich & chips. 

The shoppe, w/ its bright blue walls & corner ice-cream cone, is down-to-earth adorable & clean. The walls are H*a*P*p*Y; customers can even use a colored pin to mark their hometowns on the USA cork map. A child's birthday party here will cost you $10 a head-- see pic w/ details. 

I walked in a stranger w/ a camera & an appetite. I emerged on a high from the wonderful conversation. I returned home to eat a GREAT sandwich & to delight in a FANTASTIC milkshake (not that I partook of the latter on my drive home, of course:) 

Will DEFINITELY return when I'm in town for Crews Lake Wilderness Park & am hankering for a quick & tasty meal served w/ a side of small town hospitality. Kudos to Judy & Christopher!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1cf54dc13e8c0e1d50""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Food, Restaurants, Hot Dogs, Sandwiches, Breakfast & Brunch, Burgers, Cheesesteaks"",""business_id"":""pKWCgqQkKpumlgmbSLYX6Q"",""name"":""Moody Judy?�s""}]"

They were very nice to still be serving even though the whole market was about to close.

Really quickly I just ordered the corned beef on rye with Russian dressing.  I just found the meat to be so incredibly tender and flavorful.

What a cute restaurant!  Cuter than puppies???... mmmm.... maaaybe?  Cuter than Emma Stone or Ryan Gosling?.... DEFINITELY.  Cuter than your bf/gf?... no (okay, sshhhhh... {yes}).  It's THAT cute.  It's actually a restaurant on top of a bakery/dessert shop.  Girly as hell, but hey, if my girl's happy I'm happy.

I think we came here our last day.  Just needed something to eat, but omfg we were not expecting something so gorgeous as we got to sit on the balcony overlooking the streets of the old French Quarters.  And let me tell you, my gf's all about those cute European-ish countryside lit-by-sunrise romantic open-air eateries.  This was perfect.

Even better, I think we had the whole restaurant to ourselves!  It was just us, looking down at the beautiful world, enjoying the sunshine bathing each other's happy faces.  Attended to by a beautiful and very nice waitress.  We couldn't have stumbled upon a better spot...

...oh, and btw the food was amazing too...

1. Sucre Special Blend $3

2. Orange Juice $4

3. Caprese Sandwich $12 ""heirloom tomatoes, fresh basil, burrata, sun-dried tomato pesto, baguette"":  Delicious!  Perfectly toasted, with the greatest application of burrata cheese I've yet seen on bread.  The sauce added just the right amount of extra flavor.  It was so simple, and so divine.  If you don't know, I'm really picky about sandwiches.  Hell, I don't think I've ever given a perfect score for a sandwich until now... 10/10

4. Roasted Cauliflower Wedge $14 ""fried shallots, sambal cream, feta"":  I think this one blew her mind.  It's a New Orleans thing I guess, cause we saw this at some other restaurants too, but this one was prepared so exquisitely.  There was this yummy pink (of course) spicy yogurt sauce on top.  Plenty of texture too, with a char that almost reminds me of BBQ.  So yummy I forgot it's vegetarian.  10/10

5. Sucre Dessert $7.50 Apple Pomme?:  Unfortunately I forgot what this one was called, but my notes say ""apple pomme"", but I'm not sure if that's right because it would be redundant.  Anyway,... it was frickin' amazing!  I loved the slight alcoholic bite soaking the cake.  The cheescake texture was so light, which paired perfectly with the sweet apple pie topping.  Everything was so harmonious, including even the white chocolate!  You know how on many desserts people just love throwing on white or dark chocolate just to make it prettier, but it tastes so pointless that you just throw it to the side?  Well, here I really encourage you to take a nibble of the white chocolate with your bites--everything comes together so well.  10/10

I HIGHLY recommend you come here for brunch.  It's so divine.

me1EibSL-SisPSPGq2u1lg,PHSda9zEwtFicCICD6TP1A,5,102,"Luna Grill has finally made it's way to the 805 and I'm so glad we have a new Mediterranean option since Santa Barbara lacks this type of food. I first tried Luna Grill in Oxnard at the Collection and my taste buds were immediately turned on. They serve up fresh salads and flavorful meat dishes such as the chicken and ground sirloin. The chicken is nicely grilled and very moist with a hint of lemon flavor to it. The ground sirloin is just as flavorful and very different from what I've ever tried. 

Customer service was great here on my visit and oops my bad I didn't get the name of the gal that kept coming around to check on our table but she did a wonderful job! All of the staff quickly greeted us and made us feel welcomed. Even though it was the first day I still received the same treatment at the other location which says a lot about their customer service. Great job guys!

This restaurant is a fast food type place so you order at the register and find your own seating. The wait time was reasonable with the food being served looking freshly prepared yet still maintaining a nice presentation. Not your typical fast food restaurant so you can expect fresh healthy ingredients versus greasy fried food. 

My co-worker ordered the Mediterranean Chicken salad and let me sample it. This is definitely something I plan on ordering next time I return. The chicken was served on top of Israeli couscous with ingredients such as tomato, mint, cucumber, parsley, feta cheese and other ingredients I can't remember but the feta cheese was delicious! It sure didn't taste like store bought but more like the real deal feta.

There are plenty of options and combinations on the menu that you can customize to suit your taste buds. They also offer vegetarian and vegan choices. 

The regular hummus is my fave served with pita bread. I've tried the spicy one before and I didn't really care for it. This shareable item is plenty for 2-3 people depending on your appetite.

Pro Tip - Save your receipt! This will be something you need if you are interested in downloading the App and earning points. I downloaded the App because I plan on being a regular here and instantly earned a free shareable valued at $5 plus an additional 13 points in celebration of their 13th Birthday bringing my points to 32 after I scanned my receipt. After you reach 100 you receive $5, not bad!

SN0_nZiwe89XGuM7NXhRog,F9gyc-k7IPwJ_qkOcwJyIw,5,51,"With 4.5 stars on Yelp & open 22 years, I just had to come check this Port Richey traditional eatery out myself! I was NOT disappointed! 

I asked lovely Tina (who's been employed here 5 yrs) what she recommended. Without hesitation, she recommended the burgers. And I'm glad she did! My hamburger (minus the bun) & fries (a small upcharge) were both WONDERFUL! Normally, chips accompany the burgers. 

The thick, flavorful burger reminded me of the ones my dad would make us on special occasions. (My parents were very frugal.) I am a fry snob, & it's a rarity that I eat (& love) French fries. These were perfection-- a light crisp on the outside, a very small amount of grease, & a soft, pillow-like interior. Yummy! They were even good cold hours later. 

During the pandemic, this eatery is offering family meals To Go; phone in to request information. I arrived at breakfast time, but I was told I could order lunch if I wished. 

The menu is EXTENSIVE. Offered on the four pages are: 18 Specialty Platters, 14 Sides, 9 Egg Breakfasts, 3 Breakfast Platters, 17 Omelettes, 14+ Pancakes, 6 Breakfast Sandwichs, a Breakfast Wrap & a Breakfast Burrito, 3 Eggs Benedict, 12 Breakfast A La Carte items, 9 Burgers, 19 Sandwiches, 9 Lunch Wraps, 8 Salads, 6 Beef Lunches, 11 Poultry & Seafood Lunches, standard beverages, plus beer & wine. (I'm quite sure I've omitted a few items:) 

Pam is the owner & self-trained chef, a perfectionist by nature. Her son, Dimos, could not have been friendlier. (He tossed in a Yelp discount w/o me requesting it.) A second son does not work in the business, but both men are graduates of St. Leo University. Pam & Dimos could not have been more personable-- see pic.

Over the next year I came here a few times and it was not all that memorable, as I recall. Fast forward to Dec. 2018. I popped in here for a late lunch. We were promptly greeted, offered drinks and chips/salsa followed. The salsa was fantastic. The best salsa I can ever remember having out. The chips were fresh, crispy and were salted perfectly. Guacamole was spot on terrific. Wanting an enchilada, my server suggested the shredded chicken. She said it was more flavorful. I took her advise. They were delicious. The best I've ever had. They had a nice kick to them, however not to hot for those not looking for the heat. My son was ever so pleased with his quesadillas. 

We have a Mexican restaurant on every corner,  with more and more popping up. I struggle finding one that I think is worthy of even returning. The search is over. This placed nailed it for me.

This restaurant was a class act from start to finish. While visiting St. Petersburg my friend and I spoke to several locals who all recommended it. We were looking for something really nice since it was Valentines Day. Then while riding the downtown looper another rider again recommend Gratzzi and the trolley dropped us off right off at the front door. 

When we arrived we were asked if we had a reservation. We had only made up on our minds on the spot so of course we didn't. I was instantly disappointed because I figured there was no way they would fit us in on Valentines Day but seconds  later they said we will find you a table. They could not have been kinder or more welcoming. 

I started off with a glass of house wine while looking over the menu. They brought us some delicious complimentary bread to start with which we dipped in quality olive and balsamic vinegar. My friend and I decided to share a Cesar salad and the Biancaneve pizza which is a white pizza with herbed ricotta, spinach, bacon, chicken, basil and mozzarella. 

Both dishes were phenomenal and I could have stopped there because the portions were large and filling but the real reason I wanted to come here was because they make the pasta in the cheese wheel which is something I have always wanted to try. On the menu it is called the Cavatellii Bada Bing ($29). The  cavatelli pasta is flambéyed inside a Parmesan cheese wheel.with prosciutto, basil, and vodka. It is more than a meal, it is a show. It is prepared next to your table as they explain what they are doing. Everyone watches because it is so dramatic. The pasta was the richest cheesiest pasta I have ever eaten. A half portion was plenty. 

The service and food are top notch here. It was Valentines Day and you could have easily turned us away but instead I will remember this as one of the highlights of my trip to St .Petersburg. The night was really special. Thank you for making us feel so welcomed.

MRxO6BZDJhAKBufFh5HIrQ,apmw_lkLdwWbeYiI9ysdJg,5,51,"We came here for dinner last night and was able to find a table immediately.  It wasn't very busy because they had just opened.  My daughter has eaten here many times so I had a pretty good idea what I wanted based on her recommendations.  We started with the ""rosemary garlic fries"" (delightful), the ""charred Brussel sprouts with pine nuts"" were not overly charred and the crunch from the pine nuts added extra flavor, the ""pork belly pops"" were amazing I could have eaten a platter of them.

For my drinks I tried the ""Island Time"" a rum blended with more rum that tasted wonderful and the Manhattan.  The main course items were all equally delicious: the ""grilled cheese with pancetta"" bread was toasted with Parmesan cheese and it was delicious.  The ""wagyu sliders"" were the best I have tasted in a while.  The sliders were juicy and seasoned nicely.  

Our waitress was super friendly and kind.  The windows in the restaurant are so large you are able to view the city from any angle while enjoying you meal.  I would love to go back and try more of the menu items.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c18f54dc13e8c0ddf68""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Bars, Gastropubs, American (Traditional), Cocktail Bars, Nightlife, Tapas/Small Plates, American (New)"",""business_id"":""apmw_lkLdwWbeYiI9ysdJg"",""name"":""Bar 29""}]"

It's been awhile since I've been here but I'm glad to see the happy hour is back! Beginning at 5pm to 7pm you can grab yourself a drink from the HH menu, ranging from $7 and up. They also have their regular drink menu and also serve a few food dishes. I will try and get that menu pic next time! 

My latest obsession here is the spicy margarita! There are no artificial flavors in this drink and I especially love how it is topped off with a lemony, lavender and slightly salty foam. It's not made with egg whites either. The bartender shared his secret to the foam, but I honestly can't remember how they did it lol. My bad! But you just need to come here and try it for yourself. 

This place is Cajè coffee during the day and by sunset it turns into a speak easy. Pre-Covid the front doors were closed and you had to venture around the back to get in. Now the front doors are open and there is a sturdy parklet stationed out on the curb with outside seating. Inside seating is also available and the vibe is a nice throw back in time. Also, a little dark and romantic for those who wish to have some privacy. 

Overall a great place for coffee or great libations! The staff here is very welcoming and friendly.

bZW7S8B71ZY9v8OQwkthLg,q36uZc2hQml10YGHazJaoQ,5,68,"Secret Bao is a relatively recently opened restaurant that one should not miss. Upon entering the restaurant, signs direct dine-in & pickup/delivery customers to the appropriate station, thus moving the customer flow efficiently. After placing one's order, a number is given to display on the table. Staff bring plates, utensils and napkins prior to receiving the order.

The indoor spacious dining area is well-lit with lots of natural light. The area was immaculate and tables were being serviced and sanitized as customers departed. There is patio dining for enjoying the beautiful Santa Barbara climate, as well as being located across the street from the Santa Barbara County Courthouse Sunken Garden, which is another great place to enjoy their fare.

Staff circulates around the dining areas to handle customer's needs, and to deliver orders. I would like to give a shout-out to ""Celine"", as she was very attentive and seemed to motivate her fellow workers.

Their signature offerings are a mind-blowing selection of modern Asian cuisine with fusion selections of baos, as well as ""Not Baos"". Currently, their specialty baos include Smoked Salmon, Fried Shrimp, Maitake Mushroom, Korean Fried Chicken, Pork Belly, among others.

A sampling of ""Not Baos"" include, but not limited to, Local Halibut Ceviche, Oyakodon, Tuna Poke, Bibimbap, Japchae, and more. The menu is still evolving, but one can't miss with the soft & fluffy bao buns and their delicious fillings, as well as their rice & noodle dishes.

They have an interesting beer, wine & specialty drink selections, such as Miso Michelada, Miso Bloody Mary, Sparkling Sake Mimosa. On tap, they currently offer Draughtsman Rice Lager, 3rd Window Nelson Saison & Boochcraft Kombucha. There are wine selections as well available by the glass, half-bottle and bottle.

PLvBnPRptIRNEPlTUHQWnw,I5jxUHS1Dp2rg40eDzyiCA,5,62,"Hands down the BEST Indian food I've eaten from Tampa to Lake City. A good friend had told me I needed to patronize this restaurant. She said it was frequented by Indians & that she & her husband had never had a bad meal here. They both raved about the naan & all the varieties offered! 

Upon arrival, we decided to each order naan & share four different entrees. We ordered the Garlic, Cheese, Keema, & Kashmiri naan. (Keema is stuffed w/ mince & spiced lamb while Kashmiri is stuffed w/ nuts, raisin & coconut.) ALL were PHENOMENAL-- easily the BEST naan I've ever enjoyed. The latter two were my personal favorites; the Keema offered delicate flavors that melded perfectly while the Kashmari could be called a delicious sweet bread. As a fan of Garlic naan, the naan here BURST w/ flavor. With all the varieties, the texture & consistency of the naan coupled w/ the fabulous flavors make ordering different varieties to share paramount. (I've been told the Onion naan is excellent as well.)

Along w/ the naan, the CHILI SHRIMP appetizer @ $12 was a SHOWSTOPPER-- see pic! I will definitely order it upon our next venture here. And the Samosa was excellent; it had the most flakey outer shell of any Samosa I've eaten. (& I order the appetizer @ each & every Indian restaurant.) 

Our entrees (paired w/ white rice) were perfect-- see pic. The Goat Bhuna ($18), Lamb Saag ($18), Shrimp Vindlo ($20), & Chicken Xacuti ($16) were DELICIOUS! Soooooo good! Even though the more expensive Shrimp Vindlo was very good, the three of us each picked one of the others as a favorite.

This restaurant in Ybor (close to two large paid parking lots) offers a large, outside uncovered patio w/ a beautiful fountain & up close view of the trolley, the Ybor roosters, two sections of an esthetically pleasing dining area, a daily lunch buffet (pre Covid), one large wall TV, & EXCELLENT SERVICE. 

The MENU is extensive-- many dishes offered here that I've never seen on menus from other Indian restaurants. (These's a menu section of vegetarian offerings as well-- see pic.)

I am SO happy my three friends (who are regulars here) finally decided it was time again for Indian food. For me, Rasoi Indian Cuisine is hands down the BEST Indian restaurant in the area! I'm already excited to return!

NOTE: Unless yuu get lucky enough to locate a parallel parking spot on the street, you'll need to pay to park. AVOID the 717 PARKING lot close by. I learned too late that parking is $10-- the near-empty lot should have been my clue. Just one block further away is the City parking lot; it will cost you approximately $1.50 per hour.

UpgHDFBdprsgy31jYKfGUA,E0E901zeU9Kir_MqeYx-5w,5,75,"Arriving at 3:30, I learned Ban Bamboo closed for two hours on Saturday afternoon and reopened at 4. So, I had a little time to wander along Ridge Avenue and take in the beautiful Spring day and the local color. The street scene was active with outdoor seating at the brewery and many open doors allowing the kitchen aromas to waft out to we pedestrians. Definitely created the aura of being a neighborhood. 

When BB's ""Open"" sign lit, I went in to discover a small dining area with lovely Buddha shrine front and center, and heavy southeast Asian decor all around. A cafe in Vientiane or Pattaya would look as good. I ordered Tom Kha Soup (veggie), Beef Satay, Red Curry (veggie), Drunken Noodles (chicken), and Kai Soi (beef), to go. It was 40 minutes to readiness, so I continued my exploration of the area while waiting, and thought about what I remembered about Lao and Thai cuisine. 

While both are very regionalized so that there are many distinctions even in different parts of each country. Still, there are a few generalities that hold true. Where Thai uses coconut milk in many dishes making it sweet, often counterbalanced by the heat of chili peppers and bitterness of lemongrass; Lao kitchens lack coconuts, and use more lime and fermented fish sauces for flavor. Lao is a lot saltier than Thai. 

So, it was easy to know which was which in my package. The Tom Kha Soup came on strong on sweetness from its coconut milk/galangal base, followed immediately by a lemongrass bite. It could have used more variety of veggies in the bowl, but the taste profile set off a riot in my mouth. The Red Curry was similar in sweetness, but lit a fire from the chili paste used to turn the color crimson. The veggies were still semi firm, adding to the texture, along with the bell pepper, bamboo shoots and Thai basil. The Beef Satay was lean meat with excellent BBQ type sauce, and on the sweeter side. Drunken Noodles were definitely from Thailand in flavor and plenty spicy from roasted chili sauce. Kai Soi, on the other hand, was more a hybrid, using thin sliced beef in a coconut milk broth, mixed with egg noodles, red onion, cabbage and lemon/lime juices. It reminded of Indian curry with its sweet/sour profile. 

Although travel time neutralized the higher taste amplitudes to reduce the delicate intricacies that exited the kitchen, it was still a wonderfully entertaining meal that is well worth revisiting, along with this Ridge Avenue neighborhood.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c18f54dc13e8c0ddf42""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Laotian, Thai"",""business_id"":""E0E901zeU9Kir_MqeYx-5w"",""name"":""Ban Bamboo""}]"
0X6qeNLrlpFu06cbd5rsRA,DwSoW3CcQZuzxYi-wOxYTw,5,80,"During a recent trip to St. Petersburg my friend really wanted to visit this bakery. As soon as you mention cupcakes I'm all in.

The name of the shop is a play on the French word soirée meaning an evening party or gathering. Swah-rey was created by owners Leslie and Gregg Ciccone who noted the lack of dessert bars in the St. Petersburg area. They wanted to pair scratch made desserts with wine, craft beers, hard ciders, and coffee.They opened their first location in 2015 in the Grand Central District and a second location also on Central Avenue in downtown St. Petersburg in 2017. 

 Although they also sell cake truffles, dessert bars, creme brûlée', cream pies, marshmallows, and other assorted desserts they are most well known for their mini cupcakes which are baked in 13 flavors daily. You can order a hook up which is your choice of a mini cupcake and a mini beverage, either alcoholic or non alcoholic. 

I love that when I walked in I could clearly see that they love dogs as much as I do. They are helping to raise money for Southeastern Guide Dogs and you can purchase a treat for your dog called a pup mini. They decor is super cute with pink and turquoise pastels. I ordered a coconut mini cupcake and a special flavor they had for Valentines Day, chocolate covered strawberry. After I paid they handed me a free sample of their strawberry marshmallows. They were so delicious I had to have a container. This was a delicious stop on my recent trip to St. Petersburg. If you want to have your sweet tooth satisfied have a soirée in your mouth at Swah-rey.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1ef54dc13e8c0e32a8""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Food, Wine Bars, Coffee & Tea, Desserts, Bars, Nightlife, Cupcakes, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Restaurants, Cafes, Bakeries"",""business_id"":""DwSoW3CcQZuzxYi-wOxYTw"",""name"":""swah-rey""}]"

In my honest opinion the lobster rolls here are the best in town! There's no competition compared to this one. 

I'm glad the location is shared with the Shaker Mill and Modern Times. It gives you a chance to grab a cocktail or beer from either place. There's plenty of seating inside and outdoors.

oESxNruT3tU9tmH9ZBhZ_A,PoaNRg8e1QpLehz4Cocebw,5,75,"First experience at Bottle Cap and I can assure you that it will not be our last! 

Bottle Cap is a small but mighty local neighborhood eatery and sports bar that has been sitting in the heart of 12 South since fall of 2020! Per staff, they celebrated their 1st birthday in mid-November 2021! Before we get too far, I want to expound on ""small""...it isn't small in the coffee shop or food stall kind of way, but it is smaller than your average sports bar, and while it isn't the largest in size it is laid out well with all the space being used expertly to ensure as many folks as possible can enjoy this spot on those busy game days! 

Bottle Cap is essentially just one big dining room with a good sized bar on one end and garage doors that open to 12th Avenue on the other...and in between those two things you have a healthy mix of booths and high-tops, neon signs, cartoon caricature portraits, Route 66 style artwork, sports memorabilia and 14 TV's! The TV to table ratio is here is the best I have ever seen as there are only about 22 tables in the place and again, 14 TV's! This makes this spot the perfect sports bar as there is no way you will miss the game you are after! 

Food wise they serve up a lot of sports bar classics from sandwiches, burgers, wraps, wings, nachos and salads. In addition though, you will also find things like chicken and waffles, cheesesteak and one of my favorites, loaded fries! They also have a small brunch menu on Friday - Sunday from 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM - you will find waffles, pancakes, burritos, omelets and even steak and eggs on this menu! 

We decided on some good ole fried food to help us deal with the cold and rainy day! I opted for the Buffalo Chicken Loaded Fries and my partner got the (3) Tenders tossed in Lemon Pepper sided with fries. The Buffalo Chicken Fries were simple and perfect! The fries and chicken were fried perfectly and crispy, the blue cheese dressing and crumbles were perfectly portioned and scattered as to not overwhelm the dish and the buffalo sauce coated everything wonderfully! Keeping this same energy, the tenders were absolute perfection! First off, they were the LARGEST tenders I have ever seen. They were meaty, crispy and coated expertly in that delicious lemon pepper seasoning/sauce! 

They offer a full bar with all the staples of a good bar with a decent selection of beers, wine and spirits. They did work hard on the signature cocktail list as it features 10+ house drinks and they even have a few house shots if you are in the mood to really party...or celebrate your teams victory or ease their loss! 

Service was phenomenal from entry to exit. The host was super welcoming and got us sat immediately. He also made sure to wish us a good day on our way out. Our server was excellent, as she was friendly, efficient, attentive and helpful! 

There is not much outdoor space, but on those good weather days you can sit on the entry patio which has a few bar stools or right out front where they have a couple of picnic tables that sit directly on 12 South. 

Only things that were a miss for us was the parking and single use bathrooms. I get space is of the essence, but for a busy sports bar, single stall/use restrooms is a killer. There was someone waiting for the restroom at every moment of our visit. And I understand parking is limited in the 12 South area, but that doesn't mean I am not annoyed by it! lol Luckily, the experience and food made us forget about these two little things! 

Overall, Bottle Cap is a cool spot that I can definitely see being a solid neighborhood bar for locals near and far! We may not be living in the 12 South area, but this place is certainly going to be on heavy rotation for us!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e2d6a""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Bars, American (Traditional), Breakfast & Brunch, Nightlife, Restaurants, Pubs"",""business_id"":""PoaNRg8e1QpLehz4Cocebw"",""name"":""Bottle Cap""}]"

Needless to say I snagged a window seat for people watching purposes. My server was just as pleasant as my escort and extremely accommodating; as I am notorious for altering menus to fit my specific desires. She didn't flinch a bit and kept a smile. 

I ordered the Oyster Benedict without the hollandaise or English Muffin and added a pancake. The oysters were TO DIE FOR!!! Lightly battered and seasoned to perfection. The pancake was decent, nothing to rave about. I'd definitely recommend Stanley as a great way to start your day.

81Bp1iPKoryt4ZXcUtC7wg,mc9V_wG4QyRYew9_S8R44A,5,83,"I was fortunate to visit Eddie V's twice in late July, once with 3 wacky friends & then via invitation. I had no idea what to expect upon my first visit, although it was suggested I not wear my usual flip flops & hoodie:) 

Not open for lunch, definitely make a dinner reservation days prior to your prospective visit. Upon arrival, I learned quickly that parking is not visible from the front (although it's in walking distance), but free vallet service is front & center. Everyone, from hostesses to waiters (dressed in all black) to vallet staff, was VERY friendly. Most patrons were dressed in business casual or in semi formal fashion. (I was surprised to see so few decked out in more formal attire.)  

Due to one in our party being a wine salesman, we brought our own bottle; Eddie V's corking charge was $25. There was unintrusive mandated social distancing; per Tampa mandate, the restaurant was limited to 50% capacity, & almost unnoticeable plexiglass had been installed to separate each booth. 

The menu was not lengthy, but each & every food I tasted was mouth-watering. Sampling different foods w/ a group of friends, I reluctantly shared my  WONDERFUL $38 5-piece jumbo shrimp entree w/ jumbo lump crab & garlic:) Our Truffled Macaroni & Cheese, w/ its slightly crunchy outer shell, was INCREDIBLE-- by far the BEST mac & cheese I've EVER tasted...just UNbelievable! My friends enjoyed two different steaks (both great, especially the bone-in one in truffle oil) as well as the Chilean Sea Bass w/ light soy broth-- also delicious. The least expensive (& smallest) steak on the menu was $42, I believe.

On my second visit, we went all out. At $16, The Heirloom Tomato Salad (a Caprese salad w/ Italian Burrata) was spectacular-- it contained the freshest-tasting cheese I've EVER eaten. The crap-stuffed shrimp appetizer (2 pieces for $18) & the warm bread brought to every table shouldn't be skipped. My $36 Mustard & Wry Whiskey Glazed Salmon w/ baby yellow carrots & spinach was a worthy contender. My companion's medium rare 12 oz Filet Mignon ($50) was PERFECTION. I tasted the steak; it seemed to melt on my tongue. Our Sautéed Spinach side w/ parmesean cheese @ $12 was phenomenal (too good not to order on both visits), & our $19 Lobster Mashed Potatoes were very good (& definitely interesting); it contained pieces of claw meat, & was covered in a special gravy. Sides here are large to very large; each will feed two or more diners. We happily split a $14 flaming Bananas Foster Butter Cake that was too rich to finish--- but Oooh, sooooo good! Our most charming waiter Stephen G (w/ his Ghanaian accent that I spotted almost immediately) topped off a superb dining experience. Thank you, Stephen! 

With no alcoholic beverages, our bill for two was $179 before adding the waiter & vallet tips. At $220+, it definitely was NOT an inexpensive culinary experience, but I recommend Eddie V's if money is not an issue. (And highly recommend you order the Truffle Mac & Cheese.) I won't be returning anytime soon on my teacher's salary, but I'll jump at the chance to return to try another menu item if the bill is covered:) 

Competitor Berns is great, & perhaps a little less expensive than Eddie V's because salad & a veggie accompany each entree, unlike @ Eddie V's. But I prefer Eddie V's because the dining experience is more CASUAL, although it sadly does not offer the cool & very tacky round, red crushed velvet bathrooms that Berns harbors:)","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e2db8""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Jazz & Blues, Nightlife, Bars, Arts & Entertainment, Lounges, Restaurants, Seafood, Steakhouses"",""business_id"":""mc9V_wG4QyRYew9_S8R44A"",""name"":""Eddie V's Prime Seafood""}]"

K8SBkH_MoKEtLPpz6LhDcA,epk5jqy6do2Uq8mmnJ4H7Q,5,51,"COVID-19 TAKEOUT REVIEW

These are the times that try our souls.

To grab a break from constant at home dining, at least two or three times a week we pick up takeout meals from either a place we haven't tried before, but has been bookmarked for a long time, or an old reliable that for some inexplicable reason had dropped out of the rotation. So it was with Primo Hoagies in the Glen Roc Center near Trenton-Mercer Airport in Ewing, NJ.
Nothing like a premium submarine sandwich on a fresh sesame seeded torpedo roll to pleasure and comfort a weary heart. And, Primo, the former Italian deli out of Philly that is now an expansive regional franchise, knows how to bring that iconic satisfying experience home. 

We ordered over the phone for curbside pickup and sent the 19 year old who is spending the rest of his college freshman year at home out to secure it. Ordering a Turkey Schwartzie (sliced roast turkey, Swiss, lettuce, tomato, sweet pepper relish and mayo),  Corned Beef Schwartzie, and traditional Roast Beef & Provo Hoagalone, at $10 per, we actually had enough for two meals after cutting them into quarters and mix/match sharing. Our separately purchased bag of uber crisp & spicy Herr's Jalapeno Potato Chips were the perfect counterpoint to the soft semi sweetness of the sandwiches. 

And, an outstanding mention is demanded for the wonderful bread encapsulating the quality ingredients. Those babies were so delicious with sesame seeds generously spread atop each creation that I could easily have been happy with just them and a shmear of butter. So good!

I'm not sure how you've managed to elude me for so long, but better late than never!

This hidden gem was such a pleasant surprise!  When you first walk in you'll find that it's not big by any means, but it's quaint, cozy and charming and I think that's what makes it so special...not to mention that it's family owned and operated...nothing better than a mom-and-pop restaurant!

Once you're seated and have a chance to really look around, you can't but help admire the various works of art from local artists adorning the walls. There was an unframed penciled sketch of a woman that hung along a curtain rod that particularly piqued my interest (by the way, some are for sale).  I absolutely loved the groupings of mason jar pendants that hung from the ceiling!  They cast a warm industrial flare to the overall décor along with the oil-rubbed bronze ceiling fans.  As far as seating goes, they offer both table and booth seating.

OK, so on to the food!  I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Salad and my friends ordered the Crab Cake Sandwich and the Powerhouse Salad.  Let me just say...other than all of us absolutely loving our lunch choices...the presentation was beyond!  It's my understanding that the owner, Jeff Stewart, is the Executive Chef and it's obvious he's got mad culinary talent!

So looking forward to coming back again for dinner and the buzz is they have an amazing brunch!  Btw, just a friendly tip...it's BYOB so be sure to come prepared!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1ef54dc13e8c0e3070""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Steakhouses, Vegetarian, Tacos, Seafood, Mexican, Vegan, American (New), Restaurants"",""business_id"":""Dh65GRW4FmOEjDv_UuPP4A"",""name"":""Kitchen 519""}]"
oXfHBQZ8q4fr9qHh604VPg,5HJz1MV553ZKslOwxUKrDA,5,52,"MyThai Kitchen recently opened on Brownsville Road, Trevose, PA. It is in an old tiny strip with a narrow parking field right in front. Easy enough to get in, but a bit challenging when departing. Don't let that deter you, because once inside you enter a simple dining room with about a half dozen wood topped tables, and honest to goodness Thai dishes prepared with love and attention by folks who came naturally by their skills - they lived them from birth. No Thai pretenders here.

I was there for a late lunch, arriving just short of 3:00 to an empty house. I was greeted warmly by two women, one the chef and the other working the front room. They thanked me for coming, directed me to a table in the front corner and handed me their small double sided menu. I was in time for the lunch special. I ordered a small bowl of tom yum soup, drunken noodles with beef and an iced tea. I asked them to bring the heat. 

The soup was strongly spiced with lemongrass and loaded with veggies, including fresh mushrooms. The first spoonful took my breath away, but I adjusted to the spicy boil and enjoyed it the rest of the way. I asked for high flames and that was what I got. I was pleased they did not make any ""cultural adjustment"" for a presumed western pallette. The noodles were broad and mixed with peppers and other multicolored vegetables. Thin slices of grilled beef finished the plate, along with an excellent opulent brown sauce. Loved all of it. The 10% grand opening discount was another nice touch (without asking).

Service was attentive and attractive from the orange apron woman. She stopped by often to see how I was doing and to answer my questions. On my way out I asked to take a photo to memorialize my visit. My wish was granted. 

Take a look and tell me you wouldn't return as soon as possible for more authentic Thai cuisine!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1cf54dc13e8c0e19d7""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Thai, Asian Fusion, Noodles, Restaurants"",""business_id"":""5HJz1MV553ZKslOwxUKrDA"",""name"":""MyThai Kitchen""}]"

Keep your eyes open for this place as it can easily be missed. There are two locations in the French Quarter; this one is a stand alone (that has a larger selection and the roasted cauliflower sandwich) and the original is inside a bar. This establishment as a whole has vegan friendly options. It has a small space with a few tables and chairs. They have a restroom for customers. Friendly vibes. I love their spin on this traditional meal--amazing po boy sandwiches here.

I came for a spot of lunch. This place was one of the very few restaurants in downtown NOLA to offer a vegan version. I seen on the menu that they offer a roasted cauliflower po boy and that is exactly what I ordered. All the ingredients included Roasted Cauliflower, Pickled Radish, Dried Kale, Avocado, Romesco Sauce. You can imagine my excitement when my food arrived. I could not wait to make it disappear.

The sandwich was flavorful as everything infused nicely. The sauce was light and I could taste it throughout with every bite. Did I mention, they offer amazing sandwiches?? I would gladly return as I have my eyes on the Roasted sweet potato po boy with spiced Roasted Sweet Potato, Braised Collard Greens, Black Eyed Pea and Pecan Spread--this po bo is offered at either location, however the location inside Erin rose might be temporary closed currently due to Pandemic.

FAi7a9lw0NVeJj3GZ4PxOQ,16tjKOvMw_nOgNViq2LwOQ,5,73,"This has GOT TO BE the best fried chicken EVA!  I'm so glad I had a chance to see what Nashville Hot Chicken is all about.* The order took about 10 minutes mainly due to freshly frying a new batch.  This batch came out glistening with fresh oils on its surface which gives the skin a crispy, spicy and slightly sweet crunch. The inner white meat, as you break open and pull it apart, starts to ooze out its juices followed by the hot steam escaping into the air.  If you desire REAL fried chicken, be ready for a fattening experience that'll overwhelm your taste buds.

The sides equally played their part.  Collard greens is a side item that epitomizes the Southern  comfort food, perfectly done.  Pimento mac and cheese surprised me with the correct consistency of the cheese and I never would have thought of this match, just as a sandwich spread.

Finish yourself off with a happy ending, with dessert that is.  Dive into the melt-in-yo-mouth peach cobbler and do NOT forget the ice cream on top.  O M G, look at those fotos, Becky!

Five stars.  Head there during off peak times to avoid extremely long lines.

With a background in Business Admin, & w/ her daughter by her side, Jane decided to become a chocolatier. 

The chocolates are made on site. They contain no additives or preservatives. (The Ganaches should be eaten within 3 days-- all others within 3 months.) The chocolates will freeze well if first wrapped in foil. 

This is my second visit to this business-- my first since this chocolate factory sold. The quality, quantity, variety, & taste remain the same-- VERY IMPRESSIVE. The prices are higher now, but that may be due to the toll Covid (& Covid restrictions) placed on businesses. 

The interior is still clean & attractive-- see pics. Service today was professional & VERY friendly. This is one of only a few chocolatiers who offer an impressive line of Sugar-free milk & dark chocolates. I could have saved money by opting for a pre-packaged pound; however, I opted to personalize. My pound totaled $36.75. Expensive, yes, but absolutely DIVINE!

Available are special occassion chocolate gift sets; naughty chocolate designs (you'll have to request to see those:); chocolate gift boxes to hold chocolates; chocolate-covered apples; white chocolate; & chocolate cigars-- to name a few. I also noticed coffee & two chocolate bakery items. There are approximately 70 different small chocolate varieties made here, along w/ 11 Sugar-free offerings-- definitely plenty to please everyone. 

Sign up to earn Schakolad bucks w/ every purchase. Once you've earned 500, you'll receive $5 off your next purchase. Schakolad is a Corporate Gift Specialist.

This business has two outside metal tables w/ chairs just outside the front floor. Paid parking spots line the front & side of the building.

It is a tight squeeze going through the front door and passing along the counter, but I found a spinner right there, and had the exalted pleasure of watching the action of the cooks, assistants and servers, as they danced around each other taking care of the hot steel grill and the crush of phone take out orders, while always finding time to chat with those around them with a quip and a smile. 

This is definitely a greasy spoon dive, but in the best way possible. If you are entertained by fast hands and flying knives and spatulas, then there is no better theater in the City of Brotherly Love than a orchestra seat in the Clown House. You watch the action up close and personal, as take out orders are written directly on the white bags that will contain the food once cooked. No need for an order pad. And, if close enough to the grill, the occasional spattering of oil or home fries, or spitting bacon, will reach out to touch you gently, and remind you that there is no extra charge for the grease stains on your clothes. That iron is so full of food waiting to be off loaded onto plates or takeout boxes, that its amazing that the kitchen hasn't caught fire in the 66 years it has been slinging hash to the appreciative masses who have been scarfing their incredibly tasty dishes all this time. 

 ""Delicious,"" is the right word for the food produced here. That grill is so well seasoned from decades of eggs, meats, potatoes, peppers and cooking oil, that it might be edible. The prices are cheap enough to be downright ridiculous. My sausage, egg and cheese sandwich on Kaiser roll, with a side of excellent home fries topped with sautéed onions and green peppers, all the hot java I could drink, came to less than $7. 

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

So, I had an incredible breakfast, a month's worth of local color, and full bore entertainment from the totally engaging staff, non-stop for the half hour or so I was indulging myself. Although a rookie, I felt at home and one of the regulars. I really didn't want to leave, but I finished eating, and the next customer was waiting to take my stool.

To say the least, Nomzilla was super ""Nommy"" and an absolute pleasant surprise!

In all its essence, Nomzilla is a sushi and Asian fusion restaurant that serves a variety of dishes from common Asian dishes such as fried rice, bulgogi, curry, ramen, udon and of course, sushi. Additionally, you can get things like bao buns, brussels and wings. On all areas of the menu you can get vegan and veggie options as well. And of course you can wash all this stuff down with a craft cocktail or beer. The menu is decently hefty with options, so you could visit many times and definitely never get the same thing, but I would imagine after visiting this spot a few times you would have a favorite or seven.

I rolled in with a few friends after sushi and cocktails. They have around 30 different rolls to choose from in addition to sashimi and hosomaki options. I went classic and specialty for my rolls with Spicy Tuna and Baker Twins. The ST is your standard roll, the Baker Twins was a house roll and twist on shrimp tempura with the addition of cream cheese, cucumber, crab meat, spicy mayo and eel sauce. No lie, may be my new favorite roll, not only for the taste but the price, as it was $11 and the spicy tuna was only $6!

Drink wise, they have a well equipped and stocked bar with spirits, a great list of house cocktails and a small list of select beers. I ended up with a gin gimlet, which I did not know I wanted or was in need of! It was $9 and worth every penny.

Service was the only thing that was off here. The place was not busy and there were several servers running around, but in general it was slow. Given the current state of things, I give service a pass for the most part. While it was delayed and slow here, all the fellas were super nice and helpful when they did stop by the table.

Overall, Nomzilla is a solid place and one that may just become a regular reason I hit up East Nashville more frequently in the future!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e2bd1""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Salad, Japanese, Bars, Asian Fusion, Sushi Bars, Vegan, Restaurants, Cocktail Bars, Nightlife"",""business_id"":""FnEWE7CdxTolKWEgVKAlsg"",""name"":""Nomzilla!

How do I know this is a supermax experience? 

Because I find myself thinking about their excellent bagels even when I don't plan to be there that day, and excited when I know it is my destination. These babies have addicted me. They are my opioids. 

The shop is still in the same location, and too small for tables and chairs. Yet, the master baker and his crew have perfected the onion bagel I prefer - firm skin, soft airy interior, and ample roasted onion flakes all around. When fresh from their ovens, they are plenty good enough to eat just as they come from the bin. If you time your visit just right, you can get them still warm from baking; nothing short of a completely memorable experience. Yet, even on the normal day when they have cooled and wait for your order in their bins, like puppies in the window of a pet store, they are simply a joy to consume with a heavy smear of favorite cream cheese (veggie, please!). 

I stopped in today for my weekly fix, and picked up a bag full for the family this weekend. I figured it's time to share the bagel bounty with those I love. 

They do muffins and breakfast sandwiches, too. They look zoftig, but I am more the purest, preferring my bagels the traditional way.

cMoBwuYf73e8LQDjyUpcSw,EagkHaaC-kUozD3MPzbRIw,5,171,"Vegan Gumbo? Yes, please!

I was seated at a table with fresh cut flowers right next to a window that looked onto Chartres street; I could also see parts of Saint Louis Cathedral and Jackson square. A lovely rose scent traveled through the air in slow motion and I got a whiff, from time to time, from the flowers that were on my table (a centerpiece for all the tables), which was nice. I took a peek at their menu ahead of time so I knew that they served vegan gumbo and that was top on my list of things to try. I came here for a spot of lunch.

Louisianians seem to love their gumbo; gumbo is a strongly-flavored stock, hearty, warming, and rich. In this instance it was vegetable stock and also meat-free. It usually comes in a bowl as it is quite similar to soup and typically always served over rice. From what I gathered it is a tradition staple in regards to traditional food and It fits right in with the melting-pot nature of Louisiana cooking. I have tried gumbo many years ago. This is merely a prelude to my take on vegan gumbo. 

My food arrived shortly after ordering and I had to let it cool for a moment as it was piping hot. Water was my beverage of choice. Once the gumbo cooled down a bit I took a spoonful and it was delicious. The flavors were impeccable and I appreciated their spin with vegan gumbo; keep in mind it is a little thicker than regular soups. It had fresh seasonal veggies, scallions and all on a bed of traditional steamed rice. It warmed me up so nicely on a chilly day and a perfect dish for gumbo adventures.

Friendly vibes and good service.

s_T1UC5ae3VpvD_52CIG0A,jmG_QxXXfz2cnw9dQCXJLQ,5,196,"A delightful bakery that I stumbled across while taking my mom to breakfast next door at Metro Diner.

NOT SO BRIEF BACKSTORY - My mom and siblings are creatures of habit. They will go to the same place repeatedly without any curiosity or interest in trying other restaurants or shops. They also don't generally venture outside of their neighborhood. I can't tell you how many times I would come for a visit armed with a place I wanted to try and they would say ""that's too far"", even though in many cases it was less than 10 miles. I've always been different from my family in this way.

So I began to leave them behind about 8 years ago and ventured out into the wild unknown with just my wife and kids. Well, they slowly started to change their attitudes about this after a few years and now are far more food adventurous than they've ever been in the past. As a matter of fact, I've created a monster in my oldest sister. She goes out of her way to research new places to eat, especially when planning a vacation. 

My mother on the other hand, is still not very food adventurous. She insists on always going to breakfast at Village Inn and NEVER remembers how many countless times we've been before. ""Momma, I can't take any more of the Village Inn! Let me take you someplace new"" I begged. It took some convincing, and I honestly almost gave up because of her complaining... but she finally gave in. 

Along the way she told me how she was once more adventurous in her eating and misses a bakery she loved as a child. She went on to describe some sort of apple dessert she referred to as 'apple slices', but went on to say she hasn't seen them in many decades.

-----

Well, as we pulled up to Metro Diner, she noticed La Segunda Bakery and asked if we could check it out after our meal. I suggested we go first and before long we were drooling over the offerings in the neat and well stocked display case. My food sensory glands locked onto a delightful tray of strawberry cheesecake cupcakes when suddenly I hear ""Oh my God, they have them, they have them!!!""

Have you ever seen the movie Ratatouille and witness the moment Anton Ego take a bite of a dish that instantly takes him back in time? Well, I watched first hand as my mother turned into a 70+ year old child before my very eyes. Her excitement for La Segunda's Apple Squares was seriously more entertaining than a toddlers first Christmas. She was so pumped up that suddenly she had to have all of her favorites and wanted German Chocolate Cake as well as a few other desserts.

""Slow your roll, momma!"" I warned as her eyes were desiring more than her body could handle. ""You're right son"" she said as I paid for just the apple slices. But in a sneak move she signaled the staff to box a slice of German Chocolate Cake when I wasn't looking. Then had the nerve to smile devilishly as I finally noticed her signing a receipt.

She sampled a taste of each during breakfast and danced in her seat with delight, excited to bring them home for consumption later. She enjoyed the experience of the bakery and her meal @ Metro Diner so much that she said on the ride home after breakfast: ""I need to get out more. I wonder if your sisters know about this place.""


[ FINAL THOUGHTS ]

I'm truly happy to have found this bakery AND to have shared the experience with my mother. It was a pleasure to see my mom get so overjoyed in rediscovering a memory from her childhood. I wonder how many memories La Segunda is making for their clientele and how many countless people will have the same sort of fondness for their products. Fondness that lasts long into the future, when todays eats are locked into tomorrow's memory as the standard in which all else is judged.

Located in the heart of Philly's Chinatown, my family would frequent the city whenever we get a chance. Even though there are many dining options, we would always choose to eat here. The owner has greeted us with open arms from our very first visit. She would come by our table to chat with us often. They know us so well that even one of the waitresses memorized exactly what we always order. 

There is only two noodles that I love in the entire world. My mom's Dan Dan noodles and Rangoon's Festival Fish Noodle Soup. It is unlike anything I've ever had. I could seriously go into the kitchen and eat the entire pot.

I particularly did NOT remember any exceptional restaurants, so I asked around among my Yelp friends for recommendations.  It turned out that Sidney S., that Legendarily tireless Yelper who loves awesome hiking venues and fine red wines, has visited SB almost as many times as I've been to Paxti's.  I hit him up for some advice and he lead off with: 

""Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
 For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
 And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.""

When I convinced him I didn't need cash, he then proceeded to share several spot-on recommendations.  The first of these was what also turned out to be the best restaurant I visited in Santa Barbara this trip - Jane.

My Compadres and I drove into town on the first day, settled into our hotel, and then set out for what we hoped would be an exceptional dinner to commemorate the start of our Santa Barbara trip.  Jane turned out to be a really cozy, romantic little place on State Street, which Sidney had described as slightly upscale while still being casual and friendly - that's exactly what it was!  When we arrived we were seated at a table in front of the fireplace (not burning that evening, but still cheery).  The ambiance at this place is amazingly romantic; it's not only an exceptionally pleasant place to share a meal with friends, it would also be an excellent place for a date with that special someone...

The service at Jane is darn close to perfect; attentive without being overpowering; you feel very taken care of, but they're not intrusive.  Corkage is $20; I brought along a bottle of 2006 Turnbull Cabernet that evening, along with my trusty traveling aerator. 

The first of the culinary highlights of our meal was the Firestone Red (Onion) Rings & Spice Herb Cream.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jane-santa-barbara?select=8v7o_vu_-Vz8gNXCN-rt2g#8v7o_vu_-Vz8gNXCN-rt2g  Deliciously spicy, the batter was crunchy, hot, and wonderful!  The second was a small mountain of crispy and addictive fries disguised as a side that came with one of my Compadres' burger.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jane-santa-barbara?select=aSvJmNV1nKI3XehQgfr_xQ#aSvJmNV1nKI3XehQgfr_xQ The third were some surprising tasty vegetables!  These last I'm proud to say I ate, but am embarrassed to note that I wasn't sure what they were at first, and I had to ask - they were Broccolini (a green vegetable similar to broccoli; it's a hybrid of broccoli and kai-lan, Chinese broccoli).

Our entrees were all excellent!  I had the grilled Filet Mignon served with a deliciously savory Oyster Mushroom & Herb Cream sauce.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jane-santa-barbara?select=JbpR2rSNM80qwNfSIvyinQ#JbpR2rSNM80qwNfSIvyinQ It was tender, well season, and perfectly cooked to the medium I had requested.  One of my Compadres had the Classic Cheese Burger (Provolone, Tomato, Lettuce, Red Onion, Dijon & Mayonnaise) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jane-santa-barbara?select=avDtVqUK-1AcO5HokHCT4w#avDtVqUK-1AcO5HokHCT4w and my Pasta-crazed Compadre had (wait for it...)

JXgjHXS3jrGgM81UdBWC2A,VVH6k9-ycttH3TV_lk5WfQ,5,62,"It's been said that pictures say a thousand words, but my pictures don't come close to doing the food at Willie Mae's justice. 

FOODIE ALERT!!!
If you are planning a trip to New Orleans, you've not been here before, or you've tried Willie Maes, and it's been a minute, this is a must try. 

This is where the most amazing fried chicken can be found. If you are on a diet, want to be on a diet, you really need to pretend that this is part of your daily diet food LOL

First off, they do not take reservations. They are open most days, but I would strongly encourage you to call the day before you plan on going there just to make sure that they plan on being open. The hours posted are not always accurate.

Go hungry. You will want all of the food. 

Second off, be prepared to stand in line to get inside. It's not uncommon for smaller groups that may even be behind you in line to be seated before you if you happen to be part of a larger party. Relax, you will get there too.  When you do, you'll be met with incredibly friendly and expedient service, a clean table, and eventually the most amazing fried chicken you may ever have.

The fried chicken plates come with two choices-you may either order dark meat, or white meat, but no combinations. Ever. The white meat plate is one chicken breast that is so huge, I'm wondering where they grow these chickens. The plate also includes two large chicken wings, and a choice of one of the sides. All plates include peas. When was the last time you saw peas served on anyone's plate?! I have to say the peas were downright delicious. The dark meat plate, is one extremely large chicken thigh, one chicken leg, and a wing. You also were given a choice of one of the sides as well.

We ordered one dark meat, and one white meat plate. We also added on two of their corn muffins, and an order of their butter beans. I know, most people are ready to enjoy the red beans and rice, but I'm here to tell you go for the butter beans. They were the best damn beans I've ever had! The corn muffins weren't bad but nothing special.

The chicken. Omg the chicken. It's perfectly seasoned, with the perfect crunch, that makes me finally understand the phrase ""slap yo momma"".  The meat is juicy, and has a nice kick to it. You won't be able to get enough.  The portions are huge! We both had ordered the Mac n Cheese as our "" side"", And it was pretty tasty and cheesy. Have I mentioned that the chicken was freakin delicious ?!? 

Butter beans, where have you been my entire life?!? The butter beans are served in a big open bowl, with a huge group of white rice in the middle of them. I wasn't a fan of the white rice, but those beans... OMG those beans. I love the fact that they are prepared vegetarian style.  They taste like heaven.  Seriously wear your stretchy clothes to dine here.  You'll thank me later.  

Admittedly, I lack the ability to be a part of the clean plate club, and the waitstaff was more than happy to box up my chicken, some of the beans that we had not finished, and my muffin. I had such high hopes of enjoying it later that night. I also had wanted to try one of their desserts.

I'm pretty sure that there isn't a restaurant in New Orleans that does not offer some type of bread pudding. Willie Mae's isn't the exception.  Our waiter strongly encouraged us to try their bread pudding, and I am so glad that we did. They make one of the best bread pudding's in all of New Orleans.  We only ordered one because we were so full and sharing is caring.

The bread pudding is served warmed, with a light sauce poured over it.  I could eat this for breakfast.  It's oh so good.  Don't make faces at the raisins. They add to the yumminess.  It's light, moist, and you'll want more.  

Diners tip- wear your stretchy pants, go hungry, be prepared to stand in line, and order all the food.

My husband and I were excited to see the Omakase ($75.00 per person) option on the menu. After a long day it was nice to sit back and let the Chef surprise us. I made a request that red meat not be included in our selections since we visited a steak house the day before. 

All of the 6 selections were delectable and rolled out of the kitchen beautifully timed. This really enhanced our dining experience. I recommend dinning this way at the Ocean Hai.

They have set the bar high in all areas.  Service is spectacular with knowledge of food impressive. They offer over 300 bourbons and 40 glasses of wine to choose from. They have the areas most enthusiastic cheese program with over 60 different varieties and serve charcuteries, which  feature a number of  terrines, sausages, torchons and pates. If cheese is your thing, it is best sampled by ordering the Cheese Monger Platter for $47.00, which is a chef's selection of 18 cheeses. This could easily feed 4 people, I think. It was just too much cheese for me, as I eat little dairy.  The others in my party were in heaven.

Dinner features small plates and my fave way to do this is by sharing. Highlights for me from my most recent trip are the Mojo Palm Hearts, Fried Brussels Sprouts, Brie and Mushroom Toast, Smoked Chicken Biyrani, Snapper Ceviche, Blackened Scallops and Hamachi Crudo. The menu is constantly changing. If they ever have the Roasted Cauliflower I suggest that, as it is delicious.

What lures me back time and time again is Happy Hour, which is offered Monday- Saturday 5-7. Specials on both drinks and bites change daily. Oysters are $2.00 each with other bites being offered for $6.00. Please note you must be in the bar area or outside patio to take advantage of the HH pricing. They pack a crowd so if you want a seat strive to arrive at 5.

Check out the pics for all of their options for food. Burgers, vegan food, breakfast, lunch whatever you want.. We like that the menu has something for everybody.  Luis had their Buffalo cheesesteak again and said it was good but the Buffalo sauce they use is a bit thin so it makes the roll soggy. 

We sat in the car to eat because all of the booths were taken. I really wish they had more than four booths because we'd love to sit down and eat. Mr. Lee is friendly and probably knows most of his customers.

They were very unusual and taste great. 

We shared an entree of the Southern Fried Chicken. ($18.00) It is chicken thighs marinated for 24 hours and served with red beans and rice. The red beans had chunks of andouille and ham hocks in it. All of it was seasoned perfectly and taste great. 

To finish our meal my husband decided to try the Peach Cobbler. It was easily the best dessert that we had over the entire week.

qNiCcmqsq91UVZY4hLPt4Q,RFqxRAkKIr4JhiOT-Ytp5Q,5,61,"This review is not for cooked seafood; I did not order any prepared foods. It is solely for the variety & quality of uncooked seafood; prices; service by the local owner; & the cleanliness of the establishment.

This is a charming & clean (albeit rather small) six-year-old seafood restaurant and market owned by a lovely woman whose boyfriend owns ""The Fish Guy"" seafood restaurant & market in New Port Richey. (Her son owns a wholesale seafood company in Cedar Key.) City Girl Seafood holds just two round tables for dining in. 

I came just for the market. Prices were quite good. This is what is REGULARLY AVAILABLE inside the five large floor freezers, & the price per pound, etc:

Grouper (market price/$17.99 today), Red Snapper ($13.99), Swordfish ($15.99), Sockeye Salmon ($13.99), Salmon ($12.99), Sushi Grade Tuna ($14.99), Mahi Mahi ($14.99), Cod Loins ($9.99), Haddock ($10.99), Basa/Swai ($8.99), Flounder ($9.99), Sea Scallops U-10 ($18.99), Alligator ($14.99), Lobster Tails (market price/$29.99 today), Snow Crab Legs ($13.99), Soft Shell Crabs ($52.99 & $17.99), Lump Meat Crab Cakes ($10.99 & $7.99), Argentine Shrimp ($14.99 & $12.99), White Shrimp ($13.99 & $11.99), Craw Fish ($17.99 for 3 lbs), Frog Legs ($9.99), & Octopus ($9.99)

Available CLAMS (not frozen, of course): Littlenecks (100 @ $24.99), Middlenecks (100 @ $29.99), Topnecks (100 @ $35.99), Farm Cherrys (100 @ $34.99) & Wild Cherrys (100 @ $38.99).

ALSO AVAILABLE TODAY: Gulf Shrimp @ $15.99 lb, Jumbo Gulf Shrimp @ $16.99 lb ($22.99 lb elsewhere!), Key West Shrimp @ $19.99 lb, Dungeness Crab @ $16.99 lb, King Crab @ $27.99 lb,  Grouper Heads & Cheeks @ $4.99 lb, Whole Mullet @ $4.99 lb, Snapper Heads @ $2.99 lb, Cobia @ $9.99 lb, & King Fish Steaks @ $8.99 lb.

I happily purchased 100 Topneck Clams (which aren't found everywhere) & 2.58 lbs of Jumbo Gulf Shrimp. Both products were gorgeous & cooked up beautifully! The jumbo shrimp were de-veined perfectly! Delicious, too! I will definitely return for more, especially whenever they're needed for a gathering of friends & coworkers. (I no longer need to make the long drive to Cedar Key.)

According to the menu the owner provided me, the following prepared foods are offered: 7 fried seafood dishes w/ one or two sides, 6 fried sandwiches w/ two sides, 6 sandwiches & burgers w/ one side, 10 appetizers, soups, and salads (w/or w/o fish). 

I did not try any prepared foods, but other Yelp reviews reference it, & I found some comments noteworthy.  

There are Gift Cards for purchase; the customer selects the amount.

Open 11 AM to 9 PM Monday thru Thursday & 11 AM to 10 PM every Friday & Saturday, ""Walt"" is the owner of this downtown Safety Harbor establishment, as well as Hog Island Fish Camp & Olde Bay Cafe, both of Dunedin. Water Oak opened in Dec. 2019. 

This is the place you come for fresh, local seafood, streaks, & produce. As a diner here, you'll have the option of sitting outside @ one of the thirteen four-person tables on two separate sidewalks; sitting @ the beautiful interior bar; or relaxing inside @ one of the many tables w/ hardback chairs or thick cushions. (Frank Sinatra was serenading any outside diners on the side street. However, Jackson's Pretty Young Thing from a nearby eatery was ungratiously interrupting Frank & diners who chose to sit @ the Main St tables-- consider that should you choose to eat outside.)

Service by Bartender Taylor was SUPERB. A bubbly hostess (& the daughter of a teacher), she was filled w/ warmth & attention. From her, I learned a few of the customer favorites (although she said almost every menu offering is very good). Some recommendations: Blackened Steak Bites; Coconut Green Curry Muscles; Watermelon & Arugula Salad; Braised Beef Shoet Rips; Short Ribs Fries; Hogfish; & Grouper. 

I; however, ordered off the Specials Menu: STUFFED GROUPER topped w/ crawfish & jumbo lump Blue Crab jambalaya mix topped w/ an Andouille Creole sauce w/ a sides of fried grits & vegetables. I substituted the rice for the grit cake-- excellent choice on my part. At $32, my ENTREE WAS DEVINE--  SEE THE PICS! I especially enjoyed the perfectly cooked & perfectly seasoned local veggies. My entree was so flavorful & aestetically beautiful that I already have plans to return here w/ two separate sets of friends! I want to try more!

L*00*K @ the Saturday & Sunday Brunch menu pic! Unbelievable choices! From 11 AM to 2 PM, patrons can order off the Brunch menu OR the regular menu. Some potential choices of mine: Shrimp & Grits; Crab Cake Eggs Benedict; Fried Hogfish & Parmesean Grits; Mushroom, Arugula, & Goat Cheese Fritatta; & Bottomless Mimosas @ $15.50. 

Happy Hour is Monday thru Friday from 3 PM to 6 PM. See the menu pic for $3 & $4 food specials, as well as $4 to $6 drink specials-- draft beer; Red & White House wines; Red & White Sangria; House Margarita; Mini 1792 Old Fashion; & Single Well Liquor w/ Single Mixer. 

Every Wednesday, get 1/2 off a bottle of wine while enjoying live jazz from 6 PM to 9 PM. 

This truly is the place to eat, as well as drink! There are 13 Beers on Tap & at least 30 Wines, as well as 30 varieties of ""Sips.""

Evening & weekend RESERVATIONS ARE RECOMMENDED.

I've been introduced to the cuisine in the 80s and from one Viet. restaurant to another, the menu items seem to be the same. Nothing was exciting to me anymore. When I travel overseas or out West, the menu choices are more vast.

Finally, a Vietnamese restaurant that excites my tastebuds. It's exotic, fresh and the dishes are done to perfection. The portions are generous as well.

Here is what we ordered:
- Imperial rolls (OMG, I could keep eating these)
- Grilled Pork Patties w/Vermicelli (so delish)
- Saigon Beef Pho w/flank, shank & eye round 
- Pork Belly Rice Bowl w/Bok Choy (so tender)

You know that common orange fish sauce (Nuoc Cham) served in all Viet. restaurants? Here, it is different. I couldn't get enough of it. You can tell that they make it themselves with a tantalizing twist to it. Their Pho broth is different from most, it's nice to taste something new. This is definitely my new favorite Vietnamese restaurant. 

Service was outstanding. Our waitress, Katie, was super friendly and so is the rest of the staff. Due to COVID-19, it is outdoor dining only.

sjAWRjiroQSOnmcMWSzV9Q,2MWEEuY3dtD2DNP99sNe_A,5,122,"If you like Salvadorian food then you must check out Elubia's Kitchen! The food here is not only authentic but everything is gluten-free and wheat free. That doesn't mean the flavor is lacking so don't let that stop you from trying it out. Trust me you would never know the difference! 

I found out Elubia is allergic to gluten and wheat hence the reason for excluding it. I find when I eat foods without gluten I don't get bloated or feel blah afterwards so I'm not one to back away from gluten-free anything.

As for the food me and my co-worker went halfers to share one of their Grande Meal specials for only $19.99. This came with 3 pupusas of your choice, 5 potato taquitos, rice and beans, curtido aka cabbage slaw, and tomato salsa. More than enough food for us to share, and we even had leftovers. 

What blew my mind about the potato taquitos is that they were still crispy! Mind you this is after picking them up, driving back to work, and 15-20 minutes later eating them. I was shook! Never had taquitos remain that crisp after traveling lol. 

My favorite Pupusas were the Revueltas which is a mix of chicharrón (pork rind) beans and cheese. The other was the Diablita which consisted of chorizo, jalapeños, habaneros, and cheese. Luckily mine wasn't too spicy, but there were a few bites that had a kick! 

The curtido was fresh and a nice topping for the Pupusas. The tomato salsa is more like a soup, and it reminded me of the broth from Mexican rice. An interesting side item but it was delicious. 

The salvadorian rice and beans were excellent! It was nice to try something that didn't taste like your average rice and beans.  These had a unique flavor unlike anything I've tried. 

Ordering online was easy, and they have curbside pickup. You can also walk up or have it delivered. 

They are only open 3 days out of the week (Wed, Thurs, Fri) 10:30am-1:30pm and 4pm-7pm.

Right now they are donating a portion of their sales to our local Food Bank which is much needed! I'm glad I could contribute in some way, and I will definitely be back to continue my support.

Be careful of the breakfast cocktails they offer at super reasonable prices! I ordered a screwdriver once, (yes it was breakfast but it was my day off so whatever lol) and I assumed it would not be that strong because of how inexpensive it was.

H03NuJm9tc8GC21EL21Wdw,kw3uLKXAhRGha64MBKiMTg,5,58,"FIVE STARS for DELICIOUS VEGETARIAN Indian food when I am a lover of meat in my Indian cuisine. This family owned restaurant had the misfortune of opening just two weeks prior-- during a pandemic. The quality & taste of the food alone earns it five stars! 

The lovely owner, Anil Dubey, could not have been more gracious. He came to my table as I waited & answered all my questions (after his high-school aged son & wife took my order). 

This vegetarian restaurant has two chefs, at least one of them cooked here prior when this restaurant was Tabla Indian Cuisine. 

On the Take Out menu alone, there are 10 Appetizers, 6 Soups, 10 Chaats, 6 Indo-Chinese foods, 22 Curries, 18 Dosas, 13 Breads (including 4 Naans), 9 varieties of rice, 6 Atithi Specials (including North Indian & South Indian Thali), 4 sides, 11 beverages, & 6 Children's entrees @ $5.99 - $6.99.

I was immediately asked how I wanted my food prepared regarding spices, & for once I've found a chef who knows how to please a ""mild"" palate. The samosas are delicious. The garlic Naan is my favorite thus far (& I've tried plenty), the rice is moist, & the Paneer Butter Masala is flavorful & ever so creamy. (I did not miss the chicken.) TRULY EXCELLENT INDIAN!

The dining room is large and clean. There's a buffet that will be available twice daily once life returns to normal (post Covid). This restaurant is open seven days weekly from 11 AM - 3 PM & 5 PM to 10 PM. 

PLEASE help these local owners get off the ground running w/ their excellent vegetarian cuisine! Eat in, take out, or phone for delivery. You won't be disappointed!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0df99b""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Indian, Restaurants, Noodles, Soup, Vegetarian"",""business_id"":""kw3uLKXAhRGha64MBKiMTg"",""name"":""Atithi""}]"

Serving breakfast, lunch and dinner they manage to fine tune every last detail. Oh I enjoy their HH too ! Daytime offerings are served with one placing an order at the counter where you may visually see many of their offerings. You pay, find a seat and they will bring your meal to you.  Don't let the long lines at this hour deter you. They move quickly.  I'll mention,  you may sneak into the bar at lunchtime and receive full service. Dinner turns into a sit down more formal sophisticated , yet casual affair . It does get loud here,  without a doubt.  Not a place for a book club meeting, which I found out first hand. 

All food is prepared in-house with the freshest of ingredients. Their artisan bakery is sinfully delicious. For lunch I find myself ordering the acorn squash stuffed with the chicken salad of the day. It hits the spot. They offer hefty salads for about $8.50 with the addition of chicken or salmon for $4.75. All sandwiches may be turned into a salad. The last time I had dinner I split the watermelon salad, lump crab cakes and grilled octopus (on special) with a friend. It was all truly divine,  involving all of your senses !

I can't even describe the flavor besides it taste like....tahini lol. And some peanut butter and maybe.
I also tried their falafel and dip which was equally as impressive. The falafel was super crispy on the outside while moist and bursting with flavor on the inside.

h0rz71l0frwvwvQ3QIslRw,Am5wWa0v13NZRsJ-g9f9cQ,5,52,"Chestnut Hill Brewing Company had the foresight to be the anchor tenant in the Market at the Fareway on Germantown Avenue in the heart of Chestnut Hill. Already one of the most picturesque communities in greater Philadelphia, it has made itself a premier destination with the opening of the Market with the nano-brewery within. Now, it is possible to select from a broad variety of street food alternatives also housed within this adaptive reuse of an old warehouse, but also to wash it down with a decent beverage brewed on sight. They also have a pizza operation right there, with a Yelp deal that draws you a free pilsner with the purchase of one of their pies. These guys do everything right. 

My choices: Korean Double Fried Chicken Wings from Chicko Tako and Pumpkin Ale from CHBC. Doesn't get much better than this! 

The ale was rich with a nutmeg/allspice accent in a beautiful dark red amber liquid. Easy drinking, and a perfect washdown for the delicious wings with their crispy exterior under a thick gloopy sweet and spicy sauce. Cut through that like a hot knife through cool butter. 
The brew tanks were visible to all, and the folks working the taps seemed to thoroughly enjoy their craft. At $6.50 a pint, it was hard to find anything to complain about. Even found a seat at a community table to enjoy my snack. 

Kudos to Chestnut Hill Brewery for seeing the possibilities of producing and selling suds in this small market, and extra credit for the town council and mayor for letting it all happen to the betterment of the community. 
The creative energy here was palpable and greatly appreciated.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e2695""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Food, Beer Bar, Breweries, Nightlife, Pizza, Restaurants, Bars"",""business_id"":""Am5wWa0v13NZRsJ-g9f9cQ"",""name"":""Chestnut Hill Brewing Company""}]"
mrAGkNFNy1dkawnHbSccHg,4WCyuH0Dc6DAD79AyC0-iw,5,136,"Cute little taco spot that serves up flavorful meats cooked over mesquite just like Jalisco! There's no other place in town that does it like this. A must try at only $2 for a nice packed Al Carbon taco! 

They take Cash only! So bring that green.  

They are only serving tacos right now but next week they hope to open up the menu to serve everything else. This place and concept reminds me of when Lilly's tacos first started with a simple menu and small location. I can see this place doing just as good in the long run.

The location is a little hard to find if you're not familiar with the area. They share the space with Lily's flowers. If you know where The Habit is on Milpas it's located across the street in the small plaza. They have a few signs outside so look for those! 

As of right now hours are from 6pm-12am and they're not open everyday due to catering events. I noticed they do seem to be open on taco Tuesday though.

Ruben took my order and was very welcoming. They just opened on 4th of July and are still trying to get situated. 

The tacos were delicious! Very well seasoned and the meat had a nice smokey flavor from the wood. I'm glad to see a new up and coming taco spot that's bringing us something different. Well done guys!

BFCoPRxWZyqFn2S_lZicwg,Fzrpwup-gVia-806_ozFkQ,5,58,"Facts: Years ago, this is where I finally tried sushi for the first time. Turns out I love it, and have eaten sushi from many different places since, but this is still my favorite place for sushi. I make sure to eat here every time I am back in Reno. 

I've yet to find a place that can beat or even match their all you can eat sushi ($15 for lunch) and I'm always happy with the food. It's always fresh and well prepared.

I like to try something new each time I am here but as of now my favorites that I always get are their California Rolls and the DX Roll. I know California Rolls are too simple for some people so if I could only recommend one thing to try, it would be the DX Roll.

We always sit at the ""bar"" for all you can eat and the service has always been pleasant. Over the years I've seen different sushi chefs but all have been great and I've never had any complaints.

Never eaten anything here other than sushi but they do have a full menu of Chinese food and lots of tables and seating for that.

Since I'm so happy with this place I've never found a reason to try out other sushi places in the area, but I can't find a single reason to NOT recommend this place.

pgoY7wKWxkfY1ZBrWx04OA,k7ESc-3Odp6t9-V17YDipA,5,51,"This tavern is 7,500 square feet of excellence w/ regard to culinary creations, service, & aestetics! Only the second Chuck Lager America's Tavern in the U.S., due to Covid & Covid restrictions this dream became a 1.5 year expedition. 

Once the Wiregrass Mall space was renovated, the workings of the restaurant took shape under managers Tim & Sergio (the latter a former self-trained chef), both sent from Philadelphia to get Chuck Lager on its feet & soaring. Chef Cynthia, hailing from New Jersey, joined the team. 

The menu is the brainchild of Fabio Viviani, who created the original menu for the Delaware location. (Viviani competed on ""Top Chef,"" a culinary competition that began in 2006 on the Bravo network.) The menu consists of comfort foods from many genres-- fish, chicken, steak, tacos, nachos, veggies, fries, pastas, burgers, salads, flatbreads, 4 desserts, etc. There is something for every hungry member of the dining party, including beers, wines, & cocktails! And, BOY, IS THE FOOD GOOD! 

We ordered two appetizers, a handheld, a burger, a pasta entree, & a side-- just wanted to really sample what we had heard so much about! Everything was DELICIOUS. Unlike traditional American dishes, each recipe is tweaked to capitalize on freshness, flavors, & textures. It's those unique added touches that titillate the palate & the olfactory senses-- making for a VERY happy dining experience. The recommended Sweet Thai Chili House Smoked Wings ($12) were perfectly seasoned & cooked to just the right amount of crispness-- EXCELLENT! The pork belly-topped Deviled Eggs ($10) that both managers recommended were DIVINE. The Chicken Parmesean over noodles ($19) was a large serving & the best my companion had ever eaten; & the Smoked Brisket Grilled Cheese @ $12 (To Go) was LOVED by its recipient. My Aztec Burger w/ guacamole & bacon ($16) was recommended by superior server Karri; it was VERY GOOD, as were the Sweet Potato Fries for an upcharge of $1. Even the Cesar side salad ($7) was an original-- the sundried tomatoes made it a standout in color & taste-- see pic. Foods we didn't try, but that were highly recommended by management, were the Tuna Poke Nachos, the Steak Fritas, the Italian Steak, Chuck's Citrus Salmon, & probably a few others I've sadly forgotten. But we shall not fret for we SHALL return to try them all! YES, THAT'S HOW GOOD THE FOOD WAS! I'm already salivating for the Ahi nachos! Lol. (Returned two nights later. Unfortunately not a big fan of the Grouper Tacos @ $14. Not much grouper & not much flavor pizazz-- rather uneventful, unfortunately.)

10 cocktails; 10 bottles/cans; 7 wines (red/white); 7 House Barrell wines; 16 craft beers; 4 domestic beers; 4 imported beers; 6 Flights; & 24 Bourbons & Whiskeys (2 oz pour) round out the alcoholic beverage offerings. 

The restaurant appears to be divided into two main dining sections w/ a central bar area. There are also 10-12 wall TVs for your sporting entertainment. There's a second bar behind glass that leads to the larger covered patio on the Eastside. And there's an additional covered patio on the Southside where you'll find the main entrance. Both are complete w/ stylish bronze metal tables & chairs-- see pic.

Everyone we encountered here today was very friendly, & they appeared genuine. Our server was very personable, professional, attentive, & knowledgeable of the menu. The kitchen staff moved quickly. This establishment is very busy later in the evenings, w/ reservations for Friday & Saturday evenings strongly recommended. (Go online to reserve your nightly table from 6 PM until close; no reservations are taken prior to 6 PM.)

RINR_VrTWIYhruwyU5CcmA,g2nccd2Lc37gBAC0mFStFw,5,69,"Village Pantry Deli sits on Bridgetown Pike, Trevose, PA., in the 1960s era commercial zone. It is a true mom & pop operation that specializes in fat hoagies and deli specials of the Eastern European variety. Prices are ridiculously low for 2021. So, if you're hungry and desiring a traditional stuffed sandwich, this is your huckleberry. 

I stopped in and walked to the back of the shop where a large refrigerated display case was full of smoke meats and tubes of salami, bologna, ham and trays of homemade salads and cultural delicacies like pierogi and stuffed cabbage. I ordered a chicken salad sub, with lettuce, tomato and hot peppers on a long roll, and watched as it was made, wrapped and bagged. With Snapple and Herr's Jalapeno Chips, the cost was under $10. That was a deal and a half, and I didn't have to pay for the ton of old world atmosphere that came with.  

As I waited, I looked around at all the accessories available. Awesome pound cakes, cookies, Cento pickles and sours, and a wall of cold drinks. Service was friendly, even for this stranger, and there were enough old-time regulars to make this place a hot stove center for local gossip. Very cool.

These neighborhood haunts remind of what America used to be when the first generations settled in and started life in the New World. Now, nearly a century later, they have generally aged well, although it has a hardscrabble feel to them with narrow streets, limited parking, and undersized stores and homes that are lovely, but feel somewhat dated. 

Lucky for me, I love this sort of thing. It provides a getaway from the continual hassles of modern life and Covid anxiety.

I brought my mom here for Mother's Day and my cousin also joined us. They had never dined here before and left very full and satisfied. Especially after the bottomless cups of coffee. The coffee is strong but good! 

I ordered the breakfast sandwich, which comes on sourdough, eggs, cheese, bacon and tomato. It also includes a side of rosemary seasoned potatoes. The sandwich was simple yet it was super delicious! The bread was buttery soft, toasty and the sandwich was like a grilled cheese but with eggs and bacon inside (sans tomatoes). I loved it! 

My mom had the French toast, with eggs and sausage. She loved her breakfast and said the sausage was really good too. I wanted to sample it but we were all hangry at the time lol. 

My cousin had the Belgian waffle, eggs and sausage. She was very pleased and satisfied with her breakfast as well. 

The customer service here is excellent! Not only are they friendly but they are constantly checking on you to make sure your drinks are full and if you need anything else. They managed to bring the sunshine to our day despite the gloomy weather. Thank you guys :)

The food was to die for.. I got some sort of Chicken Calzone that had artichokes, all kinds of cheese, and fresh mushrooms.   The calzone was the biggest one I've seen.  No wonder it cost over 9 bucks.  Was worth it.  

Also ordered some Garlic bread with Cheese and Sauce.. That was yum as welll. Not too much Garlic on it.   

And the best thing was the pizza.  I tried some of my friends  ""mini pepperoni Pizza"".  It was anything from mini.. four huge slices...  The crust was thick and tasted really good.  

Im big on Pizza Crust and have to put this place up there as one of the best pizza's I've had..  If I'm ever in Reno again,.. Im definitely sliding through to this place again...","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0df783""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Pizza, Restaurants"",""business_id"":""V3gGhFQmgDZNebrC6pgHjw"",""name"":""Pirate's Pizza""}]"

We had a debate between regular and thin crust and we chose regular. It was a good decision. The crust itself had a light season-y crisp to it while the inside was soft and went well when dipped in a little ranch dressing. 
Next time in Reno, I will definitely try the thin crust just to round out my review on the place.

The chicken parmesan was a tiny bit bland but I like my food spicier than most people do, so that may not be a fair criticism. The service was just wonderful, attentive but not intrusive.   My biggest regret was that while the entrees were good, the pizzas coming out of the kitchen just made me lust for one..they looked and smelled so good..good enough that we made plans to go back next week for pizza.

The burger is seasoned with something that is so amazing that it adds flavor to the burger to make it a really fantastic burger.

""After cooked weight""
They make the burger patties larger than the actual weight so that after it's cooked you get the actual weight that you order rather than ordering for example a 1/4 burger before cooking and end up getting a smaller burger because all the fat shrink the burger.

Get the sweet potato waffle fries with the fluff it's fantastic!

The Out of this World Ahi Ceviche: What a brilliant idea to substitute shrimp with Ahi tuna and create a Ceviche Dish that is sooo amazingly delicious and unique. But to make things even more interesting, the executive chef added jicama to the equation.... 

The Clam Chowder: Delicious, clammy, creamy, thick and tasty....

The Spring Salad: Tasty salad with tons of greens, fresh strawberries and blueberries... I have to admit that I dislike goat cheese very much and I was very hesitant to taste the goat cheese that came with the salad but when I did, I could not stop eating.... The cheese was sooo creamy and tasty that did not taste anything like the goat cheese that I had thought it would taste like...

The Ahi Tuna meal was plated beautifully and the fish was super fresh.

I am a very picky diner and when I go to restaurants I have a few requests that I expect them to be filled with one time asking and God knows howmany times they just get ignored....

It's an very popular restaurant and bar with great food. I've heard great things about Lure Fish House. Originally, I was gonna eat here almost an year ago, but my plan was cut short. Had to wait 'til this visit.

Food:
I got the New England Clam Chowder soup and Lobster Ravioli for dinner. First off, Clam Chowder... Presentation was nice. It was very creamy and delightful. Heavenly good. It's my kind of soup. Excellent pick I've made. Now for the lobster ravioli. Comes with 2 pieces of bread. Really amazing. Ravioli was very good. Lobster inside the ravioli was on point. I really love the cream sauce. It's an perfect combination. It was so worth eating. 

Service:
My experience I had with the waiter was amazing. Never had any problems with the service here so far. 

Other stuff:
They do have happy hour at the certain which I didn't get an chance to look at it. It's something I would enjoy on an weekly basis. If I was living in Santa Barbara or Goleta, I would go here twice an week, just for some happy hour. But I live over 2 hours away from here. It's an no go. But will go here again, if I ever come back to SB.

Overall, excellent experience I got here. It was worth waiting for, and was my last stop before heading back home. Will be back soon.

M0nGZApv0JZxPoFhqclNLQ,44Xh-IjWDSn7XTw1hzO50g,5,54,"""He who has never done anything wrong has never done anything right.""―Amish proverb

Located in the Reading Terminal Market (RTM), the Dutch Eating Place is a true gem in a sea of amazing fare. We passed-by it several times when we first visited the market and the ""As seen on Food Network"" sign caught my eye, but I usually try not to get caught up in hype. So, we went and did our milling-about-smartly thing thru DT Philly and on the way back to the car, we decided to pop-in and see what's doing―plus I had a hankering for something sweet. 

So their Apple Dumplings ($3.25) come out in two ways: w/ whipped cream (aka boring-style) or w/ a small pitcher of heavy cream to pour on (aka get this). My girl preferred the whipped (at least she has good taste in men) but the heavy cream was absolutely delightful―but I'm getting ahead of myself.

First off the dumplings come out fresh-baked from the oven with a crust that is so deliciously crisp and buttery, and when combined with the soft, cinnamon apple interior it really made for one of the simplest and most amazing desserts I've had in awhile. Now the whipped cream was good, but the heavy cream method to me was just spectacular; yeah I'm sure the calories are increased dramatically but the rich, velvety cream when combined with the dumpling was like a pillowy-cinnamony-velvety smooth symphony in my mouth. I can't stop thinking about it.

If you come to the RTM and only have one place to eat at come and eat here. And listen to me when I say this: get two! For such a low price to flavor value you almost can't afford not to! You'll thank me later, and you're welcome.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0e03d4""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Sandwiches, Restaurants, Juice Bars & Smoothies, Food, Breakfast & Brunch"",""business_id"":""44Xh-IjWDSn7XTw1hzO50g"",""name"":""Dutch Eating Place""}]"
k9bBOm_YkYsHHOKqzMAggQ,cBiHULO8B4gTEav8eQJhuQ,5,55,"So, what's a ""flexitarian?"" 

I didn't know either until I sat at the counter in the Silver Diner, and had it explained for me in their elaborate menu. Apparently, when health consciousness is a priority, local sourcing predominates and the offerings change with the seasons, you have created a flexitarian restaurant. So, although its stainless steel & glass shell suggests a traditional Jersey diner experience awaits, in fact nothing could be further from the truth. This is a new age epicurian delight on par with the Turning Points of the world, without the pretense and only some of the accompanying cost. 

My Country Griddle breakfast (scrambled eggs, onion, green pepper, morning sausage, mushroom, potato and 2 tone melted cheddar) in a large bowl with fresh biscuit on top, was delicious and filling. The coffee was hot and strong, with a small pitcher of cold milk provided at my request (may have been from Amish cows). From my perch at the counter I could see into the kitchen where the white hats seemed to be having a good time. 

Even if you don't know anything about flexitarian kitchens, you can find your way to a very pleasurable meal @ Silver Diner. 

Nice going!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e2d7b""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Burgers, Sandwiches, Vegetarian, Diners, Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants, American (New)"",""business_id"":""cBiHULO8B4gTEav8eQJhuQ"",""name"":""Silver Diner""}]"

IFQLf1O6Jl_sq97YaoPIiQ,eEMqe1vC53vu3bkBSkekSw,5,62,"If mid 20th Century Archie & Veronica malt shops and Back to the Future big fin American road steel move your imagination, then Jem's Restaurant in East Norristown, PA, may be for you. 

What from the outside looks like another shopping center fast food luncheonette constrained by its surroundings to be a boring food dealer, is in fact a real trip down memory lane. The joint is a museum of cultural artifacts from the early days of television, with large posters of Rebel Without a Cause, James Dean, and Seven Year Itch, Marilyn Monroe. Perhaps that's why the room was full with retirees and people over the age of 70 (except for those of us needing to eat and run). This place is the original greasy spoon, for all the right reasons. 

The double ""U"" counter separated the kitchen from the dining room. My spinner faced the grill operated by two short order cooks who worked smoothly in tandem. I ordered coffee and Jem's Scramble with feta and rye toast. The full insulated carafe of java set in front of me was a nice touch. I listened to the repartee between customers and servers. It was familiar and entertaining. Most everyone seemed to be a regular. 

I noted the pile of chunk cut red bliss potatoes and metal tray of bacon on the grill. I watched eggs, pancakes, french toast and breakfast sandwiches being cooked and constructed as spatulas flew. I also saw that the grill was not scaped clean between orders, allowing residue from everything grilled there to build up and become part of the next dish. No judgement. Then, my small Scramble arrived, steaming in my face and fogging my glasses. Smelled awesome and looked like a gently beckoning glistening syren. 

It was delicious. The eggs held the sausage, onions, peppers and feta in a wet/warm embrace, allowing each forkful to hang together with all elements dancing on my tongue. There was also a hint of everything else that came before, making for a mysterious, yet very pleasant flavor. 

Maybe that is the house secret to success, or just how it accidentally became an amazing greasy spoon. Intentional or not, Jem's has a full house every morning, and is definitely doing something right.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1cf54dc13e8c0e16bd""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Breakfast & Brunch, Food, Restaurants, Burgers, American (Traditional), Coffee & Tea, Sandwiches"",""business_id"":""eEMqe1vC53vu3bkBSkekSw"",""name"":""Jem Restaurant""}]"

The food is just as amazing as I remember it to be and the presentation is just as beautiful. So glad you guys are keeping up with your unique style! Chef Ramon is a master at what he does.

All the tacos are served on a homemade corn tortilla. Not only are they delicious but they are the perfect size, thickness, and holds up very well when eating your taco. Never gets wimpy! 

Let's talk food! 

Here is what I ordered:

Chicken mole taco - The rich dark mole was slightly sweet, nutty and just a tad spicy. I added the peanuts from the salsa bar to give it that extra crunchy nutty flavor. Try it! 

Ensenada taco - Crispy beer battered cod served with cabbage, radish slices, and a mayo lime crema; which my son didn't want so it's not pictured. But he loved the fish tacos! I've had them before too and they are crunchy and yummy. 

Al Pastor taco - The meat was perfectly marinated and the pineapple pairs well giving it a nice sweet and salty taste. They don't skimp on the meat here! 

Quesadilla de Mercado - Not your average quesadilla and by far the best quesadilla I've ever had! Served on a blue corn tortilla with a nice thick slice of seared panela cheese and beautiful fresh market veggies. A true picture perfect masterpiece. The presentation was flawless! I shared half with my son and he was wowed by it too. 

Yes the food is on the pricey side but the quality, care, and effort put into making the food is well worth it to me and there is no other place in town that compares to Corazon! They truly are one of a kind and the food is made from the heart. 

I can't wait to go back and try more. Keep an eye out for the pulpo (octopus) taco when available!

Every aspect is an experience. The wait staff is ever present, and yet at the same time, you won't even know that they're there. 

The cheese charcuterie board, along with a lovely glass of wine, or a lemon drop, is a perfect way to start off your dining experience. 

You literally cannot go wrong with any of the menu choices. the seafood, the steaks, oh so delicious! There are a variety of sides to choose from, and the restaurant absolutely can meet the needs of even the most discerning pallets.

Customer service has been awesome and I would like to give a special shout out to Ray who stands out the most behind the busy bar. Not only is he a hard worker but he goes above and beyond to make sure you are well taken care of. 

Thank you Ray for being extra attentive and finding a chair for me when you really didn't have to. Now that is outstanding customer service if you ask me! 

Happy hour is fantastic! Everything on the menu is under $10. The quality of food and drinks I've tried thus far have been excellent. 

Charbroiled Oysters $9 - By far the best I've had! These are cooked to perfection in a yummy buttery garlic sauce with Parmesan cheese. 

Ahi Ceviche $8 - Huge serving, chunky, fresh, delicious, and served with thick homemade corn tortilla chips. Ask for Cholula for some heat, trust me you wont regret it! 

Crab Cakes $9 - Light, moist, flavorful and melt in your mouth. 

Baja Fish Tacos $3.50 - Crispy battered fish served in a corn tortilla with plenty of toppings. I love these! 

Wild local Halibut dinner $21.95 - Fish was light, flakey and perfectly cooked. I chose quinoa and potato cake as my side items. Both were delish.

For drinks I have to say after trying the Blood Orangecello Drop this might be my new fave. It's  not too sweet and it was made perfectly.

They had me at roasted basil blueberry margarita the first time but after my second one it was kind of weak and too fruity. If I order this again I would ask if they could make it less sweet or maybe add an extra shot.

Happy hour is M-F from 4-6pm, and Sunday from 11:30-6pm.

I dropped by the Kenner location of Cafe Du Monde for 3 reasons...
1.  It was steps away from my Kenner hotel
2.  I knew I couldn't get to the original French Quarter location until the following day
3. I needed a BEIGNET in my life urgently!

I was super excited to walk in and see the hustle & bustle going on around me.  I didnt care that the line looked a mile long. In reality there were about 15 people in front of me.  Not so bad.... i was willing to wait it out for just one bite of deliciousness. While in line i scoped out the place.  I loved seeing all the bright colored mugs for sale along with the Cafe Du Monde coffee and beignet mix. *Note to self: buy beignet mix at Original Location*.   There were tables filled with grown ups and kiddos enjoying their fresh made fluffy puffs of yumminess! Lucky for me the line sped on by and before I knew it... it was my turn!
2 orders of beignets to go and 1 order to eat immediately and a large cafe au lait.  Oohhh i couldn't wait to take a bite!
Ya'all know i don't like coffee but how could I break up a match made in heaven!

9GlJUV275mRIZs1upwihoA,FzZ2U0gLuhKVarDdXVWBQw,5,70,"Disclaimer: I usually really, really, really do not like sandwiches. The Cuban sandwich @ Marino's on Broadway is the only sandwich I've ever liked (loved, actually). So I was leery to stop in here, but I wanted to show support for a longstanding small business during such a difficult time. 

In business close to FOUR DECADES, Bearss Sandwiches first opened its doors in 1982. In 1983, Berta joined the staff, & is a staple here today. It's doubtful you'll meet a friendlier woman. She definitely brightens a room! This is a Mom & Pop sandwich shop w/ small town values & charm-- along w/ LOTS of humor. Nineteen years ago it moved to this location after selling its lot to CVS. The name remained & has been going strong ever since. While I waited, two regulars dropped in to pick up orders; everyone was on a first name basis. 

I didn't hold out much hope I'd like any sandwich from here, but BOY was I mistaken! I decided to try the Meatloaf on Cuban bread after reading the funny mention of how much Berta ""loves"" to slave over the meatloaf. I had it prepared ""all the way,"" which meant w/ mayo, mustard, onion, lettuce, cheese, & tomato. And I requested it be pressed. WOW! What a GREAT sandwich! Everything about it was fantastic, especially the Cuban bread & the meatloaf. I also ordered a side of potato salad. It was OK, but I'm not a fan of dill, & it was heavy on the dill. (My neighbor is enjoying it.) I've since been told the stuffed potatoes are exquisite! 

There's an obvious reason this 38-year-old sandwich shoppe has such excellent reviews. It's REALLY good! And a really good neighborhood staple (including Berta) is a rarity these days.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0e03be""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Sandwiches, Restaurants, Cuban, Salad, Delis"",""business_id"":""FzZ2U0gLuhKVarDdXVWBQw"",""name"":""Bearss Sandwiches""}]"

uxKwu0DaB8gIId6tJHrKtg,IKF8XeK93NsQxrXQvdGZmA,5,59,"There is little doubt that Rocco's is the best restaurant currently in Newtown. This may change as there are new kitchens opening up almost weekly in the community, but right now, this steakhouse has it going on full bore. 

I had dinner there with son and his girlfriend the other night. We sat in the glass enclosed porch that rings the first floor. The space is beautifully appointed in colonial style, and white table cloths and heavy stainless flatware. It is a pleasure to walk through the barroom and dining room to reach the porch. From that perch the Newtown bustle can be witnessed first hand. We were there to celebrate several occasions that had gone  unrecognized over the past 16 months due to Covid. We had much to be thankful for. 

Son o'mine loves his steak, and his N.Y Strip done medium was beyond excellent in texture and robust flavor. He cut me a piece knowing that this was not my normal diet, but that I was open to experiencing superior dishes. Yes, it was amazing, and it was easy to understand his attraction. I had to concentrate to appreciate everything that was going on in my mouth as I chewed and savored. His girlfriend went with a medium filet. It wasn't as juicy as the strip by observation, but she was clearly loving every bite of her medium round thick slab of beef. 

I went with the French Onion Soup and Prime Burger, knowing my diet couldn't handle a platter of solid beef. The soup qualified for possible the best of breed in a lifetime. It was rich, savory, onions, hearty beef stock, topped with french loaf under a thick layer of gruyere, seared to a near-blackened finish either in the oven or by blowtorch. The cheese had to be pierced to access the molten potage below, and to permit the superheated steam to escape. It was epic, and nearly a meal by itself.  Stupendous! 

After all this, the burger was a bit of a disappointment. True, it was a combination of ground beef, short rib and brisket, topped with onion, tomato, lettuce and melted provolone, in a brioche bun. But, flavor-wise it was a situation where more is less. I didn't get off on the mix of beef. It just didn't taste like a high end burger. I like short rib and brisket at BBQ joints, but prefer them separately, where each of their distinct attributes can be appreciated, and not muddled together. So, it was disappointing after the star quality of everything else. The fries were standard crispers. 

So, Rocco gets a less than perfect five stars here. Despite the burger, the rest of the experience was top notch, and the bar/dining area stunning In an understated way. On a less precipitous evening, eating outside would have been a legitimate option, but despite the umbrellas, we would have had to endure wet shoulders from the tropical storm brewing outside. 

No wonder Rocco's is booked solid every night. It is truly a first class night on the town.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c19f54dc13e8c0de8a9""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Steakhouses"",""business_id"":""IKF8XeK93NsQxrXQvdGZmA"",""name"":""Rocco's""}]"

CfiK7cELY36G-Pic-Xnqxg,u88VWTcy8TxuyHBv9OVazA,5,51,"Five Guys makes the best grease burgers! 

Grilled on steel that is seldom cleaned during hours of operation, the beef sizzles until well done, when it is lifted off the heat and placed on a bun already prepared with whatever accessories you want. Whatever else they do to the body, they are incredibly tasty and provide excellent lubrication to the alimentary canal. 

In addition, 5 Guys make great fries that far outclass their better known brothers. Their signature move is to toss extra fries in the brown paper bag after putting in the primary load carried in a paper cup. Excessive, but nicely so. Same goes for their shakes, which are also superior to the beef pucks. They are creamy, sweet cool ice cream splurges. Pricey, but the super caloric craving supercedes the doubtful overall nutritional value. 

So, it is an upside down meal if you think about it, but certainly a ton of fun on a bun. 

Unbeknownst to me, I had ordered online from the Five Guys on Lincoln Highway, but not the road running through Bucks County, A/K/A Route 1, but rather the one in Lancaster, PA., over 100 miles away. My bad. I wrongly assumed that their locations were in order of proximity to where I lived. Not so on their app, so the reference to Lincoln Highway led me astray. You know, I saw what I expected to see (Langhorne rather than the actual Lancaster) and impulsively jumped the gun. 

This is where Five Guys superhero Tyler stepped in to save the day. When the shop didn't have my order, he asked to see my phone and immediately knew what had happened. Not for the first time, he explained. He immediately reordered everything on the register and comped the charges, knowing I had already paid their sister store. They could correct this internally. 

Tyler's superpower - being supercool and knowing exactly what to do without making me feel like a bigger smacked ass than I already did. All this coolness made the enjoyment of my ""special meal"" almost a secondary consideration. 

Almost, but not quite, as it was digestible proof that some classy teenagers are ready to rule the world.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1bf54dc13e8c0e0f0c""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Burgers, Fast Food, Restaurants"",""business_id"":""u88VWTcy8TxuyHBv9OVazA"",""name"":""Five Guys""}]"

6r8P5rNjlqovtK1McCQGfw,AFEwa61sgl1s64MwfSaA_w,5,57,"If you enjoy classic Italian cuisine with a touch of something more modern, set in an beautifully renovated house, La Strada is calling your name. 

Its main dining room is a large round room that may have been a solarium in a past life, but has become a space large enough for a dozen or more tables amply spaced and fully windowed to permit the world outside to come in. As this is the older part of town, you can see 18rh and 19th Century buildings that remind of the pre and post revolutionary history of the area. 

The menu has all the traditional dishes, some with a special flare away from what would be expected. For example, we ordered Calamari which came drizzled with a Thai Sweet Chili Sauce and Balsamic drip. All larger rings, it was a delicious surprise treat. Our Chicken Marsala and Francais were more classical, with two large breasts each atop Penne and wonderful reductions in Marsala Wine with fresh mushrooms and lightly dredged flour coat and  Lemon White Wine base, respectively. Tender enough to be cut with our forks. 

Service was a bit slow, but not bad for a romantic Sunday night. We regretted not bringing our own bottle to this BYOB house. 

Aside - All through the meal I had the feeling that this was a Roman room in the fine tradition of Trenton's Chambersburg neighborhood, which at one time had awesome Italian kitchens on every corner. They were classy and always full with locals manging to their hearts' content. Those days have turned to Spanish/Latino pleasures, but it's great to know that that Guilded Age can still be found if we look hard enough. In fact, the owners are from Trenton, and seemed pleasantly surprised to chat briefly about the old world, where I still have an office, and loads of memories.

La Strada is of that fine school.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1cf54dc13e8c0e1a00""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Italian, Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants, Event Planning & Services, Sicilian, Caterers, Seafood, Steakhouses"",""business_id"":""AFEwa61sgl1s64MwfSaA_w"",""name"":""La Strada Italian Restaurant""}]"

I placed an order for two bags at $5 each thinking they would be in a small brown bag as I've had before; well that wasn't the case with these. They were in a much larger bag and to my surprise the portion was a lot more than I expected!

Had I known the portion served was generous I would of only ordered one bag. No complaints at all because these churros were delicious! But if you're the only one that's going to be eating them then one order will be more than enough.

The churros were still warm when they arrived and my first bite was heavenly. They were savory, crunchy but still soft inside, it wasn't overly sweet and the sugar coating was just the right amount. By no means are these churros comparable to any that are sold at a fast food restaurant! These are the real deal and once you try these you will forget about those fake churros elsewhere. 

I recommend you eat these the same day and share with friends because they do not hold up well the day after. I had plenty left over the next day and they were too mushy to eat so I had to toss them out unfortunately.

TovGr-wwVZqF7BnJguJQPA,BjeHLwKOlHyV6DJgmZxAjA,5,85,"Consuming a regular meal on a daily basis is an important task in every day life. It may be even harder to accomplish this task during Mardi Gras! 

I'm not sure if you're familiar with Mardi Gras but if you like to party I know you may not get a lot of real meals. I know we didn't! Second of all I really appreciate a place that serves breakfast all day because God knows we're not gonna make it out anytime close to breakfast time! 

Originally I found this place because I saw breakfast food but I wasn't sure if they served it all day. When I came up to the restaurant there was a huge line and my heart sunk because I was starving. I now realized there are two reasons why there's a huge line. One this place is pretty small and two the food is delicious! 

Let me give you the good and the bad news. The bad news was that the people in front of me had to wait an hour to be seated. The good news was that we didn't have to wait that long. We waited about 20 minutes. It's almost like five tables left at once and then they let five of our tables in. We waited another 15 minutes for our food and it was definitely worth it. I finished my entire plate and that's rare, I usually have leftovers. But I licked my plate clean. Actually everyone in our group joined the clean plate club!

I ate and loved the:
-Eggs Rancheros which had 2 fried eggs, cheddar cheese, crispy tortilla, black beans, salsa, and avocado creme. So good!
-Eggs Tuscan Style which has two poached eggs, creamy polenta, vegetable ratatouille, spicy greens and all of oil. Omg GET IT! Amazing!

This beautiful restaurant serves the epitome of Sunday Brunch, but for every day!  We sat outside at a wooden table in their petite garden, under a grand parasol, just taking a moment to enjoy the sun and cool morning air fragranced by flowers.  The light framed my beautiful gf to perfection while our table-neighbors played with their big dog.  Everything just felt so nice.

And the mood would be heightened further more by deliciousness!...

1. Coffee $4

2. Duck Fat Sazerac $12 ""duck fat washed sazerac rye, peychaud's bitters, herbsaint"":  What a wonderful cocktail creation!  The waitress was right--the duck fat lends a bit of a smooth rich texture, more felt than tasted.  The liquid was woody, balanced by orange citrus.  The only thing keeping this cup from being perfect was perhaps a bit too generous use of sugar that slightly overcomes the potential complexity.  Otherwise, very very nice.  9/10

3. Shrimp & Grits $25 ""head-on gulf shrimp, andouille, smoked tomatoes, cream cheese grits"":  Not your dad/mom's shrimp and grits for sure.  The grits were super ultra creamy, and extremely smooth.  Guess that cream cheese really works!--I gotta try cooking this at home.  Also, the shrimp was actually cooked surprisingly well, meaning the flesh was tender and juicy and with just the right amount of rawness to taste plenty of that brain juice and sumptuously rich guts.  The whole dish was totally covered with sauce, yet magically overall it remained light tasting--how?, no clue, who cares.  Delicious!  10/10

4. Eggs Louisianne $22 ""jumbo lump crab cake, poached eggs, Rockefeller spinach, hollandaise"":  More often than not these days, restaurants skimp so hard on the crab.  Ever order crab cake and get plenty of that cake and none of the crab?  Yeah, we all have cause that's how it is most of the time.  But, here hell no!--the crab cake is nearly pure lump crab!  Just enough binder to keep it all together, but it's pretty much invisible to sight and taste.  Just pure crab awesomeness on your palate!  And course, the eggs were cooked perfectly, as you would expect of this place.  9/10

5. Bananas Foster Waffle $14 ""rum sauce, banana, whipped cream, powdered sugar"":  Well, I have mixed feelings on this one.  The waffle was very soft but still very rich.  Great.  BUT, this was NOT bananas foster.  Just serving a tub of rum sauce on the side and raw bananas on top does NOT make something magically bananas foster.  Like come on Atchafalaya, you're better than this!  Where's the caramelized bananas?--the hot and cold ice cream?--flambe???  It all tasted great and I would say 8/10 for taste alone...... but if you're gonna label your food anything, it better live up to its name!  3/10

Want brunch in New Orleans?  Come here.  Period.

(Still thinking about it?--tell your brain to shut up.  Just come.)

sz4jOWeWQgl_Vrmi7viZJw,0TwZfZHis6e4o6sBogUJVQ,5,68,"Yumm!!! We stopped in here because I hate fast food breakfast and we needed something on the go. They have hot, made to order breakfast sandwiches in addition to their donuts! You can choose to have your sandwich on a croissant, bagel, donut or biscuit! And choose from bacon, sausage, turkey or ham. 

HOT SANDWICHES: My husband had the sausage, egg and cheese on an Asiago bagel and I wish I had gotten his! It was so good! I don't typically like sausage but it had good flavor. I had a bacon, egg and cheese on a croissant. The thing I liked most is they do not have the typical fast food, folded eggs. Those make me gag! They make their eggs fresh for each sandwich!  

DOUTS: Of course we also had to try the donuts! My husband had the Peanut Butter Banana and that butthead did not give me a bite! So I can't speak for it but I'm assuming it was good because he devoured it. He says it tastes like Peanut Butter on a banana, 12 out of 10 stars lol. I couldn't decide so I tried two minis. An apple fritter and a PB&J. The fritter was ok but not my favorite, the PBJ tastes just like a PBJ sandwich! 

ICED COFFEE: Although it was too sweet for my taste I really enjoyed the fact that instead of ice cubes you have frozen coffee cubes. So when they melt, it doesn't water down! 

Would definitely come back to those place.

ut_e0KItG-Y5y3fYAC8VAw,U6y02w21eyeHdaVerguV-w,5,136,"My 61st birthday is this weekend. To celebrate such events, My Beloved and I usually dine at a nice steakhouse - Cowboy Star is a favorite - or we enjoy excellent Italian food at Solare at Liberty Station. 

But I've been dieting, limiting myself to 1000 calories per day, which is to say, I can have a stick or a rock, but not both. So, when my bride asked where I'd like to have my special dinner, I thought not about the experience, but about the calories that our favorite places serve up. Then I decided that we ought to try something different. 

I'm a longtime fan of Gulf Coast-style boiled seafood - crawfish, shrimp and crab - especially as it's prepared in southern Louisiana. I often crave the spices used there, and I'm knocked out by the way that boiling works the spice in under the shell and bathes the meat with flavor.

I am chiefly fond of blue crab. Not monstrous, tough king crab. Not Dungeness, which I find too dense to take spice well. Definitely not salty, mushy, scrawny snow crab, which is offered on all-you-can-eat buffets for a reason. 

Nope. I'm a blue crab man, born and bred, immoderately addicted to the hunt for small bites of firm, slightly briny and buttery meat, a crab at a time, all day long. 

At about 30 calories per ounce, blue crab has little fat and no carbs, and while it's true that crab boiled the way I like it is high in cholesterol and sodium, those aren't problems for me.

In San Diego, I can buy live blue crab at the local Asian markets, in season, for about $5 per pound, which is double what one pays at the docks in St. Bernard Parish or at the seafood market in Westwego.

Despite the price, I'd be happy to buy and cook my own crabs (I own an 80-quart pot with a basket for just that purpose), but the live blue crabs available in San Diego are tiny fellers, suitable only for flavoring a gumbo or soup. They're heartbreaking, if your heart is set on a substantial meal.

An alternative is to have live crabs shipped from the Gulf Coast or the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake. I've done so, and find I lose 15% to 20% of the product, which raises my cost per crab and worse, leaves me short when it's time to cook.

Of course, there are Asian-Cajun boil-in-a-bag seafood restaurants, but I think they're for people who've never had crawfish, shrimp or crab cooked properly. I eat that food, but as I do, I always feel a bit sorry for the shellfish; they deserve to die a more respectable death.

Another choice, the one I made for this birthday weekend, is to buy crabs already cooked and have them delivered. This makes the price unreasonable, mostly due to shipping charges, but it gets me what I want. 

I'd stopped in at Today's Ketch a few times over the years, on my way back from fishing out of Shell Beach or Hopedale, so I knew their boil was good, and I'd read about their catering operation, but until last week, I didn't know that they ship out of state. After talking with similar operations in Kenner, Houma and Belle Chasse, I gave Today's Ketch a call.

While I ordered over the phone, an exchange of just a couple of calls, I was struck by how patient the staff were. I'm not sure that they should have been so tolerant of my monkeying around with shipping arrangements, as I tried to bring down the cost of my birthday dinner.

But the real surprise was that although they could have sent me small, scruffy crabs that were missing claws and were cracked along the back - you know, the ugly ones at the bottom of the pot - Today's Ketch boxed up 18 heavy and intact #1 Jimmy's, truly ""pretty"" ones, then laid in eight or so ice packs, strapped the box shut, and got them to my house less than 24 hours after they were cooked.

It may surprise the uninitiated to hear that not all seafood boils taste the same, but it's true; the quality of the food itself matters, of course, but so does timing: time in the boiling pot, time spent cooling down and hold time after the boil. Too much or too little of one of these, and your shellfish will stick to its shell, or be tough to chew, or taste washed out or overly spicy, or something else disappointing to the people you're trying to feed.

Quality is also found in the boiling spices: in the region, from one town to the next, even from one boil to the next, there can be variations in the flavors underlying the first hit of cayenne in the spice mix. Today's Ketch makes, uses and sells their own private blend of boiling spices, which I enthusiastically recommend.

Finally, and not for nothing, the gorgeous crabs they sent were delicious, but my recent experience with Today's Ketch was more than just a meal or a financial transaction. 

The folks that helped me - especially June (my first contact) and Mandy (who handled my order) - treated me like a good, regular customer, a friend, reminding me why I enjoy the time I spend around Chalmette, and locking me in as a customer when I'm in da parish and as a customer by phone, every birthday or so.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e26a5""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Specialty Food, Seafood Markets, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Caterers, Event Planning & Services, Food, Seafood"",""business_id"":""U6y02w21eyeHdaVerguV-w"",""name"":""Today?�s Ketch Seafood""}]"

PS3ij1L_0rpw1VNDcmV1Cg,qc-xhHvmyzyrBAOZUeleig,5,120,"Popped in here recently on a Friday night for the first time upon the suggestion of a yelp friend. I am not very familiar with Korean cuisine. My interest has peaked after seeing so many delicious looking photographs of Korean food that my yelp friends are eating and enjoying. 

I arrived about 7 and was promptly seated. The restaurant is far bigger than I imagined. It is comfortable and quiet. Our server was quick to follow. Very nice, yet not quite as attentive as I had hoped. I came in knowing what I wanted. Shout out to Jon, my friend from Cali, for taking the time to look at the menu for me and making a  suggestion. I went with the Chompong, which I believe is traditionally spelled  jjamppong. It was filled with seafood, veggies and noodles in a broth that was fantastic!! It had such depth in its flavor. I wanted a straw for it, as it was that good!!! Spicy!!!!! Yes it was hot hot hot and I loved it. The kimchi was quite hot too. Along with the kimchi were bowls of cucumber and pieces of the seafood pancake. A huge generous portion most of which came home with me for another meal.You can share this dish for sure. We also ordered some sushi rolls. The menu here is extensive for both the Japanese  and Korean dishes. They have a Happy Hour from 3-6 with deals on both bites and drinks.

-kdc30kgz4pA4RsPS0Y8Rw,vV57YWbrHqm1iylWmIdwVA,5,59,"Grounds for Sculpture is one of the best places to visit in New Jersey.  Yes that is a bold statement.

They currently have limited entry, so you need to book in advance on their website. It turns out that we picked a really good day to go. We enjoyed it even more because they weren't overcrowded.

The facility is basically very, very interesting sculptures and statues with a modern twist, set in beautiful gardens. My mom worked at the agriculture department for her career, and even she was impressed with the quality of the gardens. They must have a very well trained staff schooled in horticulture in place.  

I can say with a reasonable amount of confidence that the whole family will enjoy it. These days with the coronavirus, it's even more enjoyable because everything is outside. Also with cell phone cameras, you will have so many opportunities to take funny photos.

We heard good things about the restaurant on site, but we ate elsewhere that day. I will have to go back.

All the statues are pretty modern, so maybe I would've appreciated seeing some cool older ones, too. There was one sign, which was very small, that described the history of the grounds. It goes back to the 18th century when Trenton was one of the most important cities in the United States. I would've appreciated to have learned more about the history of the facility, so that would be a suggestion for improvement.

The cost of admission was $18 for an adult and $15 for a senior citizen, which I felt was totally reasonable for the amount of work that is involved in taking care of that facility.

I learned that Columbia Restaurant is a long-standing local traditional Spanish/Cuban restaurant chain dating back to 1905. It was founded by Hernandez/Gonzmart.

According to Wikipedia, this location in Ybor ""is the oldest continuously operated restaurant in Florida, the oldest Spanish restaurant in the United States and one of the largest Spanish restaurants in the world with 1,700 seats in 15 dining rooms taking up 52K sq ft over an entire city block.""

There's plenty of parking adjacent to the building in the parking lot. Upon arrival, you'll notice the beautiful deigns, mosaics and art on the exterior of the building. 

The restaurant features multiple dining rooms. We opted to sit in the indoor atrium. 

They offer an extensive menu, which makes it difficult to choose your Spanish style meal. The menu includes: Tapas, Sopas (Soups), Ensaladas (Salads), Carnes (Meat), Mariscos (Seafood), Pollo (Chicken) and Paella, ""The National Dish of Spain."" Each meal comes with freshly baked, warm Cuban bread and butter - I highly suggest only taking a few bites otherwise you will get full.

We ordered The Original Cuban sandwich, Palomilla Steak Sandwich, Spanish bean soup and an order of Cakes de Cangrejo (blue crab cakes).

* Original Cuban Sandwich 5/5
* Palomilla Steak Sandwich 5/5
* Spanish Bean soup 5/5
* Cakes de Cangrejo 4/5 (a little salty) and texture is a little too soft for my liking. Wish it was crispier.

If you plan to order any drinks, I highly recommend the Andalusian Fresa Gimlet. I don't really drink, but wow, this is a drink I'd totally be hooked on. It's basically Wheatley vodka combined with fresh strawberries, fresh basil and fresh lime juice. It's shaken and served on the rocks. It's so delicious and refreshing!

The service is friendly, professional and attentive.

AQxuQ5dnezWpH5W0F1P7ng,GXFMD0Z4jEVZBCsbPf4CTQ,5,140,"2 Large dark for $11.50 each?! Sounds expensive? You're right, but don't be fooled, it's definitely worth it! So along with the entrees, each of them come with 2 sides! So let me break down what we got:

Large Dark (Thigh and Breast, $11.50):

We ordered a medium heat for the chicken, but honestly, the heat was pretty intense! The pieces of chicken were definitely large, not what I expected! Underneath the two pieces of chicken were two loaves of white bread to soak up the sauce from the chicken. 

Pimento Mac & Cheese (3.5/5):

The hype, can you believe it? I can now, accompanied with the seasoning it wasn't a bad side, but honestly, it could've been better. 

Fries (4/5): 

Great seasoning, went perfect with the chicken! I love how the fries were extra crispy, and not too salty either! 

Banana Bread Pudding ($2.75):

My brother ordered this one, and honestly, it's definitely better than the cobbler. The chilled surface accompanied by the soft but crunchy crust was what really made this dessert LEGENDARY. Now with that being said, most banana puddings I've had are rather mild, but this one was sweet and not overly sweet! 

Cherry Cobbler (Seasonal, $3.00)

I loved the pie crust, and it came out extra hot! It wasn't too sweet, but cobbler definitely shouldn't taste like straight sugar. I can definitely say my preference was more towards the banana pudding in this competition, so definitely go with that whenever you come here!

This is a small establishment on MLK Blvd. It has three inside booths, an ATM, & two padded benches. The five sisters (& a family friend) started this restaurant, & some continue to work in it-- see framed wall pic.

Spinach and Artichoke Dip - Local made in house. 
Chilies & Cream Pizza - Local house roasted green chilies, local organic beef, Sonoran jalapeño cream sauce, zucchini, pesto, onions, garlic and mozzarella. 
Isabella's Ice Cream - Local handcrafted and natural (free with Yelp check-in on this day).

Yelp, thanks, WOW!  The tea was refreshing and crisp,  the dip was hot and creamy and the pizza, well, those chile's made it a Southwest dream. These items were the BEST, BEST, BEST I've had ANYWHERE! The service staff was attentive and shared info on the local vendors.

PJKnG3zwjPeNP8E1ViM9pA,UfWjaifeYmyldKxlEYI9cg,5,52,"This dive got my immediate attention when I happen to walk past and gave a yelp check to see what's up. So with no recommendation and not being on my to try list I gave it a try. The killer reviews made my mind up to get in the door and I was thrilled I did. 

Most importantly is don't worry about the appearance, it scares off some I bet. The white cinder block building with colorful birds is a bit odd, but let's just call it unique. The location is on the shoulder of the not so great St. Pete. I felt safe during the day. Parking is off street. There is a sidewalk patio with two tables. A line out the door provided an idea this place is legit. 

I waited a minute to find the line was waiting on orders and proceeded to the counter. A nice Venezuelan woman assisted me. I pleaded with her to help a poor tourist on foot and she laughed. I had no idea what to order, but wanted an arepa. After a little discussion because the line was building I decided on the #7 Bao arepa fried.  

The dining room is tiny, maybe five tables tops. A couple bar stools for the counter. The area was clean and the aroma from the kitchen and food pouring out was heavenly. The customers were a mix of young and old, White, Black, Latin. The atmosphere was lively and light. If I had not known I was in Florida I could have been in South America. All the staff was Venezuelan. 

My arepa was delivered around 15 minutes after my order. The Bao is described on the menu as Sweet & tender Asian pork, carrots, spinach, scallions, cilantro sesame & house made sauce. I did not have to take a single bite to tell you it would be marvelous. The presentation was exceptional. The first bite confirmed it was to die for. Everything worked harmoniously and exploded with flavor. The textures the taste it was all there and authentic as hell.

7xruB0q2mRKYbeWSZalaWg,8Vo6LN9gqULhXzoxj5k6kQ,5,102,"After several visits and trying new dishes I'd say The Black Sheep is well deserving of an updated five star review! Afterall I love supporting local businesses.

Chef Ruben is not only passionate about his creative culinary skills, but he is also a down to earth humble guy who makes you feel right at home when dining here. I love how he explains each dish in detail prior to ordering and upon serving. The staff is just as great!

The best part about The Black Sheep is the food of course! Here are some of the more recent dishes I've tried and my take on them.

Roasted Bone Marrow Bruschetta - A must try! This fatty appetizer is full of buttery goodness and it will have you wanting more. You will need a moment of silence after eating this. The flavors combine so well together and the grainy mustard adds that extra special flavor.

Wild Boar Spare Ribs - These little meatsicles slide right off the bone once you pick it up! That's how tender the meat is. Our waiter said to be sure we top the meat with the Asian style red cabbage slaw that it comes with. He was right and I suggest you do the same.

Roasted Cauliflower ""Nachos"" - This colorful dish is all about crunch and texture. They really nailed the homemade tortilla chips. Light, crunchy, and not greasy at all. The whole combo of roasted cauliflower, crispy kale chips, sliced red jalapenos, cilantro, green onions, and queso fresco is not your typical nacho and that's what I loved about these. You can get your veggie intake and not feel guilty eating these.

Burrata - A pillowy soft Italian cheese made in East LA by an Italian man. If I could find him I would buy all the burrata I could afford! Yes, it's that good. Served on a fresh bed of mixed greens with a light vinegar dressing, this is a great starter.

Duck Confit - For those who have never tried duck it does have a similar taste to chicken so if you're curious about it I'd say go for it! This duck is not gamey at all and has great flavor. It was juicy, moist, and flavorful. I especially enjoyed the cipolini onions, carrots and roasted potatoes that accompany it. 

Tacos de papas - Made with purple Peruvian potatoes. This is a simple taco but delicious and the potatoes are really creamy. I love a good potato taco! 

Yucatán style pork belly taco - The pork belly is infused with habañero, jalapeño, and I think serrano chili's but it's not too spicy where it takes away from the delicious pork belly. Served on a yummy homemade corn tortilla. 

Mesquite grilled wagyu skirt steak taco - Ummm yes please! The meat was tender and melted in my mouth. Topped with a creamy avocado sauce this taco was jammin!! 

If you have any room for dessert and want something light then try the chocolate mousse! It's light, fluffy, not overly sweet and chocolate heaven. 

Ok my lengthy review has come to an end here lol but in a nutshell give this place a try!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1ef54dc13e8c0e31ab""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""American (New), Beer, Wine & Spirits, Food, Japanese, Bars, Asian Fusion, Ramen, Restaurants, Cocktail Bars, Nightlife"",""business_id"":""8Vo6LN9gqULhXzoxj5k6kQ"",""name"":""The Black Sheep""}]"

ATKGbagMvYBjNm5liml7wA,304FY8qhcOpm9SIkrzmhoQ,5,62,"My family and I were seeking out a restaurant that was open for an early dinner or Happy Hour before 5 pm. Surprisingly, not as an easy of a feat in downtown Santa Barbara as one would think! I had been wanting to try Reunion Kitchen + Drink since it is the ""new kid in town"" with a stellar location. I had heard positive things through word of mouth and via Yelp. Best Bonus: They happened to be open all day! 
Since several of my family members were visiting from the Midwest, I was also excited to have spectacular sunset views of the Channel Islands given its location right on the beachside boardwalk.

Upon entering, they did a nice job with the renovations of the historic Cabrillo Pavilion that it is housed in (lower level; upstairs is a rental space). The size of the restaurant is much smaller than I had expected. One third of the restaurant is an outdoor patio with heat lamps. Since they didn't have same day reservations available via Yelp Reservations, we just showed up. They had an indoor booth that sat five of us but were accommodating to bring a chair for the sixth. Our waitress--who sadly I don't recall the name of--was extremely welcoming and attentive. So much that they accidentally made an additional cocktail and gave it to the table!

The majority of us shared a bunch of ""Snack Plates;"" all of which were perfection! These included:
- Coconut Shrimp: Nice and crispy without being over cooked, paired with a crunchy delicious Thai Peanut Salad
- Short Rib Sliders: Nice comfort bar bites with a soft bun hugging crispy onions, marinated pulled short rib, and horseradish kick
- Avocado Wontons: Satisfied all senses of being colorful due to greenery and watermelon chunks, crunchy, and all-around fresh plus healthy
- Miso Garlic Noodles: My least favorite item that I would not recommend; instead go to Oku for their butter noodles dish. This one was over miso'd causing it to be soft and soggy
- Handcrafted Cocktails: All were fan.flippin.tastic! While the prices are quite steep ($14-18), they offer a variety of unique mixologist-quality drinks of all liquors. Thankfully they had a decent amount of booze to offset the price (in comparison to the Rosewood Miramar). We particularly enjoyed Strawberry Lemon Drop, Jalapeño Margarita (if you love some spice) and Sunburn.

I was surprised to learn that Reunion Kitchen + Bar is a small California chain with locations in Anaheim Beach, Laguna Beach and now this one. Given this fact, I was not too shocked that everything from service to food was spot on. Yet, it still says a lot since it is sooo shiny new. Nice work Reunion! 
My one criticism would be to have more dessert options since it was limited to two types of cupcakes; neither of which sounded appetizing. I definitely plan to reunite with friends for their weekday Happy Hour served 2-6 pm (side note: menu in Quick Tips)!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1bf54dc13e8c0e0a3b""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""American (New), Restaurants, Salad, Burgers"",""business_id"":""304FY8qhcOpm9SIkrzmhoQ"",""name"":""Reunion Kitchen + Drink""}]"
TVTR_7C0XcXvepyrbk8QkQ,4FdsX3MbkcdBRAr1aymF6A,5,83,"Today I'm celebrating Thankful Thursday by giving 5 stars to this local restaurant formerly known as the historical Paradise Cafe. 

I came here with my cousins mainly for a drink, because they had already eaten. But we decided to order their pozole and avocado tostada. The outdoor seating on the patio is quaint and inviting. The bar inside is open for happy hour and has reasonable seating.

Our waitress Kaila was very informative and knowledgeable about the drinks and menu. She tended to us frequently and had great suggestions for drinks! I was very impressed with her service, and for that I am thankful. 

The pozole was a nice hearty serving and had a poached egg, which I've never seen in a traditional pozole. That was a nice surprise and kicked it up a notch. Even though it was meatless, it was still satisfying. The weather was cold, so it was the perfect option to warm up. The avocado tostada was a different spin as opposed to the avocado toast. A nice little snack to munch on. 

They offer oak-grilled meats and use seasonal produce. The food here is considered to be ""Ranchero"" cuisine with Mexican, Spanish, and chumash influenced dishes. Think cowboy dishes, that is the theme here. 

Happy Hour is 4pm-6pm on the weekdays, but only available at the bar. Brunch is offered on the weekends from 10:30am-1:30pm. I would recommend reservations if you're coming with a big party. 

Overall, we had a nice time here and the service was great! I am looking forward to coming back to try more items on the menu and checking out their happy hour.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1ef54dc13e8c0e3373""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Chicken Shop, Desserts, Food, Breakfast & Brunch, Barbeque, Mexican, Bars, Nightlife, Cocktail Bars, Restaurants"",""business_id"":""4FdsX3MbkcdBRAr1aymF6A"",""name"":""La Paloma Cafe""}]"
Vn9KwGsunOfhgBIFUp7JDA,m4kvY0viCwxqRtgOycnKVQ,5,85,"Mony's left me unimpressed the first time I came here having tried the tacos al pastor, asada, and chicken. Maybe it was a bad day but the meat was very dry. Even with toppings it still didn't work. 

After my latest visit I can honestly say they are one of the best Mexican spots to check out here in the 805! They were also featured on the Cooking Channels ""Taco Trip"" with chef Aaron Sanchez. Some of my fellow Yelpers were lucky to be filmed and made a cameo on the show too! Pretty awesome :) 

I finally had a chance to try the chicken mole combo. For $10.75 you get a generous portion! It comes with beans, rice, warm corn tortillas, and lots of chicken covered in their delicious mole. Totally reminds me of how my great-grandma use to make hers. I can't wait to try the mole enchiladas! 

The barbacoa is a must try! Whether it's in a taco, torta, or just get the barbacoa plate. Trust me you won't be disappointed. By far the best meat I've had!! They've nailed it here with how they marinate it and the seasoning is perfect. The meat is super tender and juicy. Yessss get this!! 

They have a great salsa bar with some unique choices. My faves are the creamy avocado, peanut, and salsa verde. They also have a pistachio salsa but I love the peanut one! 

Be sure to put this on your list of restaurants to check out if you're ever in the Funk Zone or just planning a day visit here.

Nashville is the home of hot chicken and Hattie B's is mecca. It would be sacrilegious to give them anything but a 5 star, if not for reputation alone 

Not all reviews need to be 1000 words, and this one of them. Good sides, lots of beverage choices, and no joke, some of the best flavored and most well fried chicken out there.

The only negative about Hattie's is that the secret is out and the lines are insane. If you're an out of towner, do yourself the favor and don't come to this location, especially around lunch time. Go to one of the other locations about 5 miles away.

-yp2CUuDensn6D0uu9C3TA,mtvT7uRey3F395STFRM1Tg,5,57,"I was told by fellow Yelper Sandra B. that this was a must-try, so I finally got the chance to go with some friends. Yeah, it's dang good. This took a bit of time to get a reservation on a Saturday night, as we were able to catch something last minute when a reservation opened day of. Hooray. 

There are two levels to the restaurant, and we were seated in the back of the restaurant, next to the open kitchen, in a cozier room. I always like the open kitchen concept, and I'm glad it's becoming somewhat of a trend across restaurants in America.

What we ordered:
- Beef tartare toast: The beef tartare was a massive portion, and really filling and rich, which I really enjoyed.
- Pumpkin toast with brown butter: This was just sweet enough to complement the seeds and the scallion(?) on top, and just savory enough to be a filling appetizer.
- Uni with scrambled eggs and yogurt: Just to be adventurous, we gave this a try. The sourness of the yogurt really came through, and the richness of the uni and eggs really mixed well together.
- Octopus with blood orange and citrus:The octopus portion was sort of small, but went well with all the citrus notes, and was cooked perfectly.
- Duck ragout pappardelle: Also a small portion, but the ragout was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of saltiness and tenderness. The pasta was fresh (obviously), which gave the dish a really great chew. 
- Short rib with kimchi vinaigrette and pear: The short rib is unbelievably delicious. The hint of star anise and the tenderness of the meat just really makes the dish great. Best dish of the meal in my opinion.
- Wagyu beef brisket and fall vegetables: Not quite as unique as the short rib, but delicious nonetheless.

Service throughout the meal was excellent, and it helped that we were next to the open kitchen and got to see our food come out right away. The prices were easily on the expensive side, and the portions are a little on the small side, but the execution and flavors are perfect.

Really glad I got the chance to try this, and it's become one of the reasons that I really believe in the Philadelphia food scene. Not that I didn't believe in it before, but everyone kept telling me that the scene was up and coming, but I know think that it's actually arrived. Regardless, overall, Vernick was an absolutely great experience, and I can't wait to try again.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c19f54dc13e8c0df4a0""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Food, Restaurants, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Diners, American (New)"",""business_id"":""mtvT7uRey3F395STFRM1Tg"",""name"":""Vernick Food & Drink""}]"
zk2zLtb6OWIlgXel5CdILg,GXFMD0Z4jEVZBCsbPf4CTQ,5,70,"Yeah, I've completely bought into the hype, and I have no regrets. My friends (and the rest of Yelp) raved about this place, and after trying, I completely agree with them.

Had the fortune of being able to do Hattie B's twice during my 3-day trip to Nashville: once at a pop-up stand during the Music City Bowl, and another for takeout dinner on New Year's Eve. The pop-up only served tenders, but holy cow, those tenders were really great. The chicken had soaked just enough in the hot sauce, and there was still a crisp, despite the tenders being ""wet"" (heh), and dipped in the ranch, it was unbelievably good. It was that experience that made us realize that we had to try it for real the next day. The thing was that some people in our party also wanted to try Edley's BBQ for dinner the next day too, so we came a simple agreement: do takeout for both. Bang bang, and we're done.

Pro-tip: Do the to-go online ordering. It'll make your life so much easier, and it's really convenient. We did a massive online order and walked in and out without have to wait at all. And it was still absolutely delicious despite sitting in the containers for about 15 minutes. We managed to get more tenders, 2 large dark meals, and 1 large white meal. I usually prefer dark meat, and I have to say both types of meat were really good, especially with the pickles, white toast, and dressing that they gave us. Hoo-wee.

I can't speak too much about the service, but the people behind the counter were very kind and patient (I feel like you'd have to be with those crowds), and from the looks of it, they were very efficient with churning out orders to the masses of hungry people. Prices were very reasonable, with most meals being about $12-18, and easily very filling ones. The value, therefore, is definitely great.

You can feel it was cooked slow and it definitely was packed with flavors. So good! The Mac and cheese casserole hit the spot!

Nashville Jam was one of the spots that made us fall in love with Nashville, and here we are kicking off 2022 as official Nashville residents! 

Since our original visit a few years ago, Nashville Jam has continued to grow in many ways, but has remained the same small, local, family owned spot with the character we have come to enjoy so much about this area. While much hasn't changed with the menu, they have added quite a bit of seating to the front and rear of the building. The front has a covered tent area with a few tables sitting truly outside, and the back has an actual built and constructed addition. It is essentially a large covered carport structure, but they have added thick plastic around the exterior with fans/heaters inside for when the weather demands either. This space is filled with about 9 - 10 picnic tables plus the wait station. 

Over the years we have sampled many things from the menu, but it doesn't matter what we switch our main up to...those smoked gouda grits are always on the side! Today I tried the Baron's Benedict which is a slight upgrade on the standard biscuits and gravy. You get two open faced biscuits smothered in pepper gravy, two sausage patties and an egg on top. Those biscuits were fluffy, the sausage was excellent and that egg was cooked to perfection! May be my new go-to!

Dark, cozy, and a casual atmosphere is how I would describe this little hidden gem. 

I hold this place near and dear to my heart because it brings back fond childhood memories of dining here with my family back in the day when it was the most popular Chinese restaurant in town. It was always a treat to come here for dinner and Shirley temples! 

So to have a sliver left of what was once Jimmy's Oriental Garden is priceless to me. It's no longer a chinese restaurant but they do serve up great appetizers and burgers.

Now it's Old Fashions, Mai Tai's, Horni Margs, and more! I don't normally drink Old Fashions but I can honestly say the one they handcraft here is pretty outstanding! Not to mention the delicious luxardo cherries you get with this drink yummmm...

The Singapore Sling and Mai Tai are also winners! You really can't go wrong with any drink you order here and they serve them in cute tiki cups.

The fried appetizers are a must and everything I've tried has not disappointed. The Fried dill pickles and Zucchini are perfectly cooked. You would expect them to be mushy inside but these are not! Reuben egg rolls and Veggie egg rolls are delish.

At 11, he sold them 5 for $1.00 and took home $100.00 each day, after splitting the proceeds with his supplier. Today, they are still a bargain @ 4 for $1.00. Partner Len Lehman, who believed in Dan, has been rewarded by the storefront on Frankford grossing 1.7 million last year! 

Twenty five years later, from when he was 11 and with all the twists and turns, they are rolling in the dough and Dan did cut the mustard! 

Celebrating his 10TH year in business and franchising the Philly Pretzel Factory in 10 states, with 159 of them being in the Philadelphia & Delaware areas. 

Dan's dream was to bake pretzels all day and to sell them hot, as customers walked through his door. The pretzels are sold curb side all over, from Sesame Place to any part of Philly. 

The correct name is: Philly Pretzel Factory and it has won numerous awards, like ""Best Pretzel of Philadelphia"".   I do believe they are awesome and probably the best I have had. 

Dan loves to emphasize the fact these are ""Real"" pretzels. Their menu ranges from perfectly salted to unsalted and to minis and logs. They wrap pretzel dough around a hot dog and bake them off. Now this, I have to try!  They offer 10 different dipping sauces, but I'm a mustard kind of gal. 

Soft Philly pretzels have been coming out of Bakeries since 1920, but most of them have closed down. Dan created a lasting empire and added to the fame of one old and proud City, Philadelphia!

It seemed most of the customers were tourists or temporary residents (snowbirds), believe me for a full time Florida resident this can be annoying at times, I guess I could be somewhat loud and obnoxious when I'm on vacation, well maybe not but it's no less annoying especially when alcohol is involved whether it early morning or late night. Maybe I should have participated in the Bloody Mary Bar.

Pardon me for the rant I was so distracted I almost forgot about the food - Chorizo and Cheese Omelette with pico de gallo and hot spicy salsa yeah baby this combination had me wishing there was a Mariachi band in the room, what wait... I ordered a biscuit with this I swear a biscuit shouldn't be a choice when ordering this combinación picante de amor exótico ole'.

Our server Jeremy was excellent - he did everything but juggle the condiment bottles and spin the plates on his head while break dancing, no really very cordial, professional and on top of things I mean everything from start to finish. The coffee was amazing it would make Juan Valdez proud if he wasn't a fictional character - rich, bold and McDonald's Hot - yes sip it at you're  own risk, maybe it's a secret brew and boiling gives it, its full-bodied aroma with a hint of smokiness that will delight the palette of the serious coffee drinker and all of this for under forty bucks including an appropriate gratitude. I wouldn't change a thing except for switching the biscuit out for a tortilla and drink whatever the guy from New York sitting at the bar was guzzling...","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c19f54dc13e8c0deb7f""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Restaurants, American (Traditional), Tapas/Small Plates, Seafood, Breakfast & Brunch, American (New)"",""business_id"":""Ps7Q7BOKzJO4nDTUhbk43Q"",""name"":""Clear Sky Cafe""}]"

I heard about their great Happy Hour and Great, is an understatement! Glass of Duckhorn Merlot for half price? Yes please! St Supery, Chauvignon Blanc, yes sir! 

We ordered a wide array of apps and I have to say that everything was exceptional!

All of it was 5/5 stars! We also had their crafty cocktails, so damn good! You can't go wrong with any of them. The cotton candy martini was more entertaining than refreshing. I would skip on it if you're looking for a sweeter drink, it's more dry. Speaking of drinks, try the strawberry basil Capiroska-sooo refreshing! 

Our server sucked on our first visit but I didn't give a damn because the food was that good! Yeah, if you have several tables to tend to and you only focus on one, you're not a good server. Now we've been back a few more times, we had Matthew and Matt. These two servers were so awesome! We just had one bad server and we'be been back many times. 

Oh, and if you happen to sit at the bar, Miner, is the man to see! He is fricking AMAZING! Love him! He was so friendly and attentive! He is the man to see if you want to try out new drinks and he would let us try out samples of his creations! When coming here, we always have a room at the Atlantis, so we can always indulge.

I've only had raw oysters in my life before tasting these chargrilled oysters. And I guess if there's a first time to try a chargrilled oyster it might as well be in New Orleans!

Holy of all things! One of my very favorite delicacies I've ever eaten! 

Buttery! Cheesy! Warm! Juicy! Garlicky! Salty! Tender! Lemony! Sweet! It's like an ocean of flavors exploding in your mouth! You better believe that I literally licked the sauce from every crevice of the shells! Could care less who was watching! Maybe having a few hurricanes helped with that as well!

This place specializes in Creole & Louisiana cuisine which means everything is packed with lots of flavor! 

Set in a vibrant & fun environment located in the heart of the French Quarter. 

Live entertainment included as well when a drunk guy came over to the window and peed right in front of our table.

It's about $3-$4/taco and they are on the smaller side but I don't feel it's over priced, especially for the area because they are good quality. Definitely not a cheap, fast food taco! They have such unique flavors. Last time I went I had the shrimp Banh mi taco, the vegetarian portobello taco and the chorizo taco. All were delicious!! The shrimp Banh mi was probably my favorite. So juicy yet the tacos stayed together, they did not get mushy or fall apart. They each were full of flavor and I ate every bite!! 

My husband opted to have his tacos with a lettuce wrap instead of tortilla. He had all chicken (he's not very adventurous lol). But he liked that he could sub for a lettuce wrap taco (they are perfect for low carb diets)! 

I love the rustic/modern decor of the place. They offer inside and outdoor seating on a patio. You can bring your dog on the outside portion!! Huge brownie points with me!! Where pupper can go I will go.

I started my meal with their moscato. It was light and fruity. I ordered their Chicken Piccata. It had fresh tomatos and asparagus. I love that I can taste the lemon capers and their butter sauce was all over my angel hair pasta. The chicken was cooked to my liking. It was soft, tender and still juicy. I think I devoured the meal very quickly. I I ended the meal with their famous Apple Cobbler. It had vanilla ice cream on  top of it. It was fresh from the oven and pipping hot.

Not in the best neighborhood but unlike its sketchy location the food is nothing short of one of the best authentic tasting Mexican food I've had. We literally just drove to our neighboring state and had lunch here in Reno. The restaurant is the unit at the end of an older property in a strip mall. It has a private parking lot shared by its business neighbors. There is also street parking available.

Inside is not very big with some booths and table seating.  We chose a booth and was approached by a young waitress who provided us a couple of menus. She wore a mask but I hope they sanitized those menus often. They weren't paper to be disposed after each use. We placed our orders shortly after. I chose an enchilada combo plate that came with rice and beans. Hubby ordered a carne asada burrito. My meal was delicious, cheap and plentiful. My husband's beef burrito looked good too but said he preferred the carne asada grilled. He still ate it hungrily, though. LoL We also enjoyed the complimentary chips and salsa. 

The restaurant is family-owned and they checked on us often to see if we needed anything. We didn't need 'to go' boxes... we wolfed down everything ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

This open and airy rustic hot spot is housed in the renovated City Water Works building and serves up Native inspired seasonal food & spirits. It celebrates the vibrant fusion of flavors from the local Florida waters and land that once was home to many Native Americans. I met a friend for cocktails and hors d'oeuvres at the Community table inside and Ulele delivered. The portions were huge, the service was impeccable and the cocktails were hand crafted. The elegant Lobster Claw Cocktail was chilled and served in a martini glass with spicy horseradish sauce. Pulpo (Octopus) Carpaccio came thinly sliced & dressed with a piquant piri piri sauce. Ulele Pale Lager Beer was the base for the cheese sauce blanketing the decadent Crab Macaroni & Cheese. Crispy Okra Fries were tossed in lime and ready for dipping in a homemade ketchup.

The sandwich I ordered had a special pizzazz to it that I would not be able to make myself. It definitely hit the spot. I even had surgery on my nose a couple weeks before, but the taste still jumped out at me.

The mains were Roasted Garlic Chicken - fire-roasted broccolini, Espelette Yukons and Romesco sauce . My son loved it and I did too.

The roasted oysters with sambal garlic butter are wonderful. They are usually a standard order for me here. That and the kale salad are my faves. The scallops with the carrot puree are so delish. You can't go wrong ordering this dish that arrives nestled with brussel sprouts, kale, almonds and raisins with a drizzle of bacon aioli.

Summer 2016

""Pleaaaassse no more junk food,""' I said to my fambam. ""Let's go to this highly rated restaurant on Yelp!"" I probably sounded like a snob but I didn't want to get a stroke during this trip. 

We went to Fork and the hostess said,""Unfortunately, we can't seat eleven people today, we're all reserved for Father's Day."" 

Oh crap. I forgot. Well, we are in downtown, we'll find something! Across the street was this pho place and they were able to seat us! HALLELUJAH PRAISE THE LORD! Oh, and an old Vietnamese guy cooking in the kitchen was a good sign!

We started with the crunchy egg rolls. The server suggested to put it in the lettuce wrap and I liked it even better! I had the beef shank pho with beef meatballs. All the meat were cooked perfectly and the broth was so good I wanted to sip it with a straw. My toddler, who refused to eat, slurped the broth from her bowl and ate a lot of meat. The thai iced tea was creamy and and oh so refreshing. My belly was happy and I'm sure my heart thanked me.

It was really impressive how our server were able to put everything on the table in a timely manner, with such a big group and all. No one really waited too long for their order. My sister's bahn mi sandwich took awhile but that order was to go.

My total: ~$20?

The meat was very well marinated, and I liked how the provolone was pungent.  Many eateries won't do that because most Americans don't like pungent cheese.  The broccoli rabe had also been perfectly sauteed with lots of garlic.

It's so much fun eating at the counter with all the people wandering by in the market.  The service was very efficient and no-nonsense, which I like.

Staff was friendly and awesome the whole meal. You could tell that they were genuine people and not just overly polite just for service. We enjoyed talking to them (we had a trainee and her trainer) at various points throughout as they checked on us.

After hearing about a LGBTQ+ bar opening in town, my husband and a fellow gaybor (gay-neighbor) strutted in to check it out on a Friday eve. Funny enough, I ran into four other Elites during their visit! Apparently this is the hot spot ""to be and be seen."" The space is a modern, clean bar with a large L-shaped outdoor patio juxtaposed within the gorgeous San Marcos building courtyard. Inside there are are board games available, hand-sketched framed art, potted plants and plenty of welcoming rainbow flags. 

We were greeted by the lovely bartender, Zephyr, who gave us an introduction to the various food and drink offerings. CB&T offers a fair amount of craft beers by bottle, can or on tap, along with local wines by glass or bottle. For those who are more adventurous, they also have various crafty cocktails--not to mention some delicious sounding Mocktails. We all went with red wine by the glasses from some of our favorite local vintners including Stolpman, Margerum and beyond. For some pre-dinner bites to hold us over, we enjoyed the homemade Kettle Chips & Ranch Dip, along with The Ranch Charcuterie Board. The flavors were spot on and good size portions that were perfect for sharing.

If you're looking for live entertainment, stay in the loop on their Instagram page since they often have bands in the evenings, drag shows or other fun events.

So proud to welcome Crush with open arms!

Our order consisted of a couple dozen oysters, a couple ponds of boiled crayfish, and a fried seafood platter. 

The NOLA oyster is different from the Pacific oysters, they are bigger and meatier. The Pacific coast oysters are more briny and harder in texture. The NOLA oysters are softer. 

We ordered the first pound of Cajun boiled crawfish, they were so good we ordered another pound.  

The best item of the meal was the breaded fried fish of the seafood platter. I forgot to ask what kind of fish it was but it was so tender. With the platter there is fried oysters, shrimp, fries and slaw.

PSoRD22OEocqSjbYKjI24w,gYYMQeg4X8FUcCxXI4c2Tw,5,164,"Cheesesteaks are a part of my patrimony. Mom said I ate my first bites of cheesesteak before I was two years old, a sandwich brought from my father's sub shop, and with all that family and food and glowing childhood association bouncing around in my head, it was inevitable that I'd grow up loving both steak sandwiches and people who enjoy them as much as I do. 

In fact, I married a Northeast Philly native, my very own ""Philly Special,"" and while I've got a million reasons to love her, I love her all the more because she loves the sandwiches at Bustleton Avenue's Steve's Prince of Steaks.

Steve's serves delectable hand-held meals that start with house-made sub rolls done right, by which I mean to say, rolls that are a tad yeasty, with a barely-perceptible crackle to the crust, rolls that provide an intact hinge and a slight chew. The bread's filled with thinly sliced medallions of tender rib-eye steak; grilled onions, if you eat them; and cheese, melted into the meat and vegetables. The shop also features a ""pepper bar,"" a shelf lined with pickled, fried, chopped and whole chiles and other hot stuff.

Meat, cheese, ""with"" or not. That's it. That right there is all you need to know. 

Well, okay... I mean, you can order a hoagie or a chicken steak at Steve's, even a hot dog, but why would you? I don't care how late it is or how drunk you are; Steve very thoughtfully put the thing you ought to be ordering in the name of his place, and if reading is hard for you, you can just point through the window at the grill, and the counterman will take care of the rest.

Chicken... sheesh.

Also, let's talk about cheese:

Not everyone who loves cheesesteaks appreciates the charms of the nacho sauce-meets-epoxy that is Cheez Whiz, and if you don't care for it, you should order something else.

Definitely don't order Whiz for the sake of authenticity.

Despite the American misconception that ""it's not a cheesesteak without Cheez Whiz,"" inspired, no doubt, by the Cheez Whiz-Industrial Complex, the fact is that originally, Philly steaks were cheese-less, and Whiz, which came later as a cost-saving and efficiency measure, ISN'T EVEN THE FAVORITE AMONGST PHILADELPHIANS. I'm from the DC area, where, like many Philly natives, we use Provolone or American on our steaks.

And finally, Steve's Prince of Steaks doesn't take credit cards, and they don't offer ample parking, hot coffee or Coke products, or, that chicken thing notwithstanding, a menu so varied that you can literally order any of 38 million combinations. 

You know who offers all of that? Subway does. 

And now, if you're unhappy with your choices at Steve's, you know where you can go.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c19f54dc13e8c0dec39""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Sandwiches, Cheesesteaks, Steakhouses, American (Traditional)"",""business_id"":""gYYMQeg4X8FUcCxXI4c2Tw"",""name"":""Steve's Prince of Steaks""}]"
ypeMfWN6j8lFSUHcspD2zQ,NZgyOwVn-7-6ioWMS8lkpw,5,59,"5 stars...For me I have to say that the last time I had Falafels and Shawrma this OUTSTANDING I was in Israel, Egypt and Turkey. The owner is Israeli so you can taste how authentic the food and the love that has gone into all the dishes. He has mastered his craft, accompanied with exceptional customer service! He is friendly, courteous, and professional.

Mana Mana Middle Eastern Restaurant Clearwater, Florida is open Monday through Saturday for lunch and dinner (11:30am - 7:30pm). You can enjoy fresh, authentic Middle Eastern cuisine such as Falarfel, Shawarma, Kebabs, Hummus, dips, salads, Baba Ganoush, Schnitzel and more, ingredients include olives and olive oil, pitas, honey, sesame seeds, dates, chickpeas, mint and parsley.  Catering is also available!  

Falafel is a deep fried ball or patty that is made from chickpeas or fava beans and spices. Falafel is served with many types of sauces, including tahini or a falafel hot sauce. It can be served alone, or as in a falafel pita sandwich.

Shawrma is thinly sliced cuts of meat, like chicken lamb rolled into a large piece of flatbread or pita that has been steamed or heated. Inside the pita, foods like hummus, tahini, pickle and vegetables.

The exterior was well maintained and the gasoline prices were competitive for the area.

54HPfwl4Mqc8_y8flVCxLg,HNI6qvswn1KYybgJVqUWGg,5,57,"On the same square as 1st Asian Supermarket in Mayfair, Philadelphia, in a corner brick two story, stands Marinucci's Deli. Those of you familiar, already know that it is a high volume higher quality Italian hoagie gold mine that creates stuffed sandwiches loaded with Dietz & Watson meats and cheeses, and a few signature pieces. Those of us who haven't been there before yesterday now know that this place is a legendary Philly landmark (30 years in this location) that turns out among the best Sammies in the city. 

I stopped in after a heavy afternoon of food shopping next door, and ordered two ""small"" 12"" torpedos with Rare Roast Beef & Provolone and Roast Turkey & Swiss, both dressed with lettuce, tomato, mayo, oregano, hot & sweet peppers. Both To Go. 

Weighing in at about one pound each, we tore into the roast beef on the drive home. It was spectacular! The meat was fresh and tender, the provolone mildly tart and dry, that combined with all the accessories for a dynamic and delicious bite and chew. The best way to attack this zoftig big boy was with two hands and aggressive squeeze and stuff into the mouth, just like with a cheesesteak. We tag teamed it, my partner holding it in front of my face, while I grabbed with one hand and directed it into my mouth. It only worked at stoplights, but a couple of large bites did the trick. No fuss, no muss. Only a sesame seed from the roll jumping off the bread onto my lap before slipping to the floor. 

The Turkey & Swiss was just as good. Top flight ingredients and delightful eye opening taste. Both were good for two meals apiece, so we finished them later that evening with good brew and jalapeño chips. 

Marinucci's is one of those Philly joints that leave a lasting impression and a strong desire to return whenever in the neighborhood, which fortunately is about once a month. 

The corner of Brous and St. Vincent is a true destination for everyone seeking variety in their low budget culinary exploits. Vietnamese, Chinese, Boba and Marinucci's all in one square of Mayfair is a foodie's dream come true.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0df825""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Delis, Restaurants"",""business_id"":""HNI6qvswn1KYybgJVqUWGg"",""name"":""Marinucci's Deli - Mayfair""}]"

I've brought my young teen children in here to learn what great food, service and ambience means, and they are going to be better people for it.  In fact, I may have created Food Snob Monsters, but that's ok with me.

Colleen is the ultimate professional, and has the staff to prove it.  Yes, it's pricey, but worth every penny.

Pork buns, lobster escargot-style, and the most amazingly different calamari are the perfect starters.

Every salad is made with perfection, and it's the only time I'll consume a beet and like it.

All entrees are presented beautifully, and every bite is worth closing your eyes and taking a minute to enjoy the flavors.

Usually birthdays and anniversary.  It's definitely the only place in Reno to find actual upscale trendy dining.  You don't feel like you are in Reno when you walk in.  To the reviewer that said 4th Street Bistro and Sezmu are better, I'd like to argue your appreciation for fine TRENDY dining.  The head chef and owner has been known to take off for weeks at a time and travel to find out what is new in the culinary world.  Yes it's expensive, but it's worth it.

If you call ahead and make a reservation and specify an event (i.e. birthday or anniversary) they print a special menu with the date saying ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY SO AND SO"".  It's a really nice personal touch. The maitre D, I believe her name is Coleen, is always friendly and ALWAYS remembers us, even though we only go 3 or so times a year.  I'll base this review on our meal last night, though I would give 5 stars for every visit we have ever had.

service: impeccable.  Servers are knowledgeable about all menu items, waters are always full, and plates cleared at the correct time.  

atmosphere: fun, simple, funky, trendy, clean.

bathrooms: clean.  super important.

Food:  we started with the lump crab cake with sun chokes.  If we come for one thing, it's this dish.  It's served in a hot skillet and is seriously to die for.  The sun chokes are amazing, and they don't skimp on the crab.  We followed it with a December salad.  It was an awesome home made thin ""cracker"" (for lack of a better term from this pregnant lady) with mixed greens, prosciutto, heirloom squash, heart of palm, and an awesome light vinaigrette.  My main entree was the Tasty Scallops, served with bitter greens (a perfect compliment to the sweet sauce that accompanied the scallops), and green chile grits, which I'm pretty sure were sent straight from heaven.  My husband though, his dish was from out of this world.  He ordered the fillet, medium rare.  The steak was cooked perfectly and topped with a wonderful pesto spread.  the scalloped potato's were thin and stacked perfectly.  And the best part, were the charred brussel sprouts.  If you think you hate the vegetable, you would have your mind changed.  So.  Amazing.  We ended the meal with 2 desserts.  One was a brownie sundae, served with home made salted caramel ice cream, a home made torched marshmallow and add a brownie and peanuts.  Then we tried the chili chocolate soup with churros to dip.  WOW.  

Bottom line, if you really appreciate good food, you have to come here.  They also have a great liquor/wine selection, but we don't drink so I can't comment on that.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c19f54dc13e8c0deeb6""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Restaurants, American (New), American (Traditional)"",""business_id"":""47OfnYwhB3NTM8Tx_sNnbw"",""name"":""Lulou's Restaurant""}]"

They've actually *improved* their food again:

The rib eye steak has less salt than before which makes a huge difference, the swiss chard that comes with it is also not so creamy and has a better texture.

The pork buns appetizer was to die for - I love the presentation, they are almost like street food in the presentation and the taste is amazing.  What looks like a pita bread or tortilla is actually the same dough used in making baozi but as flat bread.  You've got to try them - awesome.

Scallops and clams appetizer? Fresh, cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly.   It's a nice pairing if you decide to split the ribeye and this dish with someone for a little 'surf and turf'

Also - I'd highly suggest the Four Graces Pinot Noir or the Duckhorn Cabernet Sauvignon - both go with that ribeye oh-so-well.

Oh my goodness, that was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth!  Next I split the romaine hearts salad with my companion.  It wasn't really anything special.  We also had the Ribeye carpaccio--it had jalapenos and cilantro on it.  YUM!

For desert I had the caramel pots de creme.  It was really good, but I think the warm chocolate tart stole the show.

A couple years back I missed one of my best friends graduation meals here (official yelp apology) but I wouldn't miss it again, if say you graduate from somewhere else in Reno, and um, want to eat at Lulou's.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c19f54dc13e8c0deeb6""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Restaurants, American (New), American (Traditional)"",""business_id"":""47OfnYwhB3NTM8Tx_sNnbw"",""name"":""Lulou's Restaurant""}]"

For appetizers, we got their hamachi ceviche. Awesome combination of flavors but the hamachi could be fresher. Also got their lump crab skillet cake which was great as well. Wish it came with more bread but that's ok, we can leave that to Olive Garden. For entrees, I got their prime dry aged New York steak with their potatoes au gratin. It was excellent. The steak pretty much melts in your mouth (I had it made medium rare) and the au gratin was out of this world. My boyfriend got the lamb. I didn't try it but he said it was tasty as well. 

Their menu is seasonal so everything I listed here may not be on their menu forever. It was a pricy date night but well worth it.  Our meal with a bottle of wine was $210 including tip.

The food is to die for, with lots of creative options and the dressed up usual standbys. I ordered the filet, very rare, and they actually made it very rare! (I'm not used to this). The seafood is just as good, with particularly fresh crab. The wine list is impressive, and the sommelier is very knowledgeable and polite, as is the rest of the staff.

So instead, it's our anniversary...birthday...special occasion times when we leave the kids (and they are older--not good for little kids) at home because this is about as special as it gets. 

From the outside, looks are deceiving. A one story pinkish building at the edge of mid-town. DON'T WALK ON BY because what's inside is like Dorothy stepping out of her black and white Kansas house into the full techno-color fantasy of OZ!

Eclectic it is. You walk into a ultra modern essence of an upscale New York bar-giving a high-tone, technical feel but wend your way out the patio in the nicer weather and you are treated to a tree-covered eating area that is just delightful with a bit of a sweet B&B or Fairfax, California,  feel. The staff is that to which all of Reno wait staff should aspire. They are friendly, courtesy, respectful and anticipate your needs before you do. Water glasses are filled at precisely the right time, food comes and plates are removed in faultless timing, recommendations are pitch perfect. 

The food is fantastic. I love to cook and usually judge restaurants with ""could I make this better?"" and with Loulu I cannot...no way...ever. The selection rotates so I always can choose from a new menu (as we only go on special occasions--remember) and I have NEVER been disappointed. I have had lobster appetizers and pork loin (and pork is something that is definitely an eat at home meat) that will knock your socks off. As for the libations...it's a full on bar that makes a fairly good martini. My only recommendation is that if your bringing your own wine, make sure it's at least a $100 bottle because the corking fee is the price of an entree. 

Never had a bad meal here...never expect to have one. Just passed our anniversary (spent that in Hawaii) but birthday is coming up!

The New York Strip Steak is ****ing amazing.    It has taken the crown that their ribeye had in all ways.  The taste, the texture, the whole experience of eating that steak was amazing.    It comes with potatoes o'gratin that you have to order to experience, it's served almost like lasagna but my description does it no favors.  I'm in love.

My wifes tilefish? Also amazing, rich, tender and perfectly cooked along with the most amazing bacon fried rice you'll ever eat (light and fluffy).  It was a great experience.

For those of you that want to experience why I like this place without spending an arm and a leg, just go to the bar - order your favorite drink along with their pork bun appetizers.    Don't gobble it either, enjoy that piggy flavor slowly and carefully.  It's like bacon that melts in your mouth.

Seeing as I gave this place 5 stars, you can guess it was the former!

We were looking for something in Reno that would sate our foodie appetites, and it looks like we've found the place we're visiting every time we come visit.

We ordered the foie gras, pork buns, spicy duck soup for appetizers.  My wife had the short ribs over noodles, and I had the rib eye.

Foie: Seared nicely, a pretty generous portion (we've paid twice as much for half the portion).

Pork Buns: My wife thought they were a bit salty, but I absolutely LOVED them.  Asian bacon on a bun.  What's not to love?

Spicy Duck Soup: Rich coconut-based broth.  Wasn't as spicy as we'd hoped, but given the establishment and the need to appeal to all visitors, was very well done.

Short Ribs: The mark of perfect braising is when you can barely touch it with a fork and it falls apart, while the braising liquid is thick and flavorful.  The bed of noodles was the perfect complement.

Rib Eye: Here we go.  I like steak.  I've had a lot in my life.  In the Bay area, my favorite is Sundance in Palo Alto, and I've had places like Alexander's in Cupertino.  This piece of meat that was served to me at Lulou's?  Perfect.  Almost as good as Sundance, and definitely as good or better than Alexander's.  Oh and the wafer thin fries were awesome too!

After trying their cupcakes at a birthday event, I immediately wanted more. I love desserts, but if it's overly sweet then it's not for me. By far these cupcakes are the best that I've ever had! I've pretty much tried every flavor they offer and they are all equally delicious. The ingredients are top quality, and the amount of sweetness is just right. They are light, airy and melt in your mouth. I love that they offer the cupcakes in mini form or whole, so if you want to try all of them, then the mini cupcakes are perfect for sampling. They make these daily, so you don't need to order them unless you want a specific flavor or amount for a special event. 

After eating the cupcakes, I knew that I would order my son's birthday cake from this bakery. I placed my order online, which was very simple to do, but the hard part was choosing the flavor of cake, filling, and icing. Mind you, my son likes any cake so I knew whatever cake I ordered he would be happy with. I decided to order the 6-inch mocha cake with Bavarian cream filling, fresh strawberries and whipped cream icing. I was able to customize the cake online by choosing a decoration, color, and wording. Due to COVID times, and not being able to have large gatherings we had a safe celebration at home. Hence the reason for keeping the cake décor simple.  

The cake was perfect in every way! The whipped cream icing was not too sweet, the mocha cake was moist and flavorful, and the filling was creamy and light. This is the type of cake you could eat without your teeth hurting from the sugary sweetness of a typical store-bought cake. 

I will definitely be ordering from here again, and now that I've written this review I am craving their cupcakes ha ha.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1cf54dc13e8c0e2089""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Patisserie/Cake Shop, French, Food, Restaurants, Bakeries, Cupcakes"",""business_id"":""u9oG6CVhS9dJR5ZHS5q23A"",""name"":""The Little Things Bakery""}]"

For the little ones, there is a play area and tons of outdoor space to roam around and get the wiggles out. I love the playset they have and that they thought to include that in their space.

Get everything.  Honestly, you can't go wrong here.  Love this place!  Everything I've tried has been delicious and the service is quick and easy.  Prices are cheap and portions are filling.

(Sadly no photos, it was a couple years ago before I started yelping lol.) The service could not of been any better. Our waiter was very informative, attentive, professional and respectful. Drinks were never empty and no crumbs on the table. 

The food and wine were amazing! We started with the tastings of all three soups and there were no complaints on any of them! For entrees my husband had steak and truffle Mac n cheese and I ordered the lobster. This was the first restaurant I had gone to that gives you the whole dang lobster! Lol! It was huge and cooked perfectly. I was so full but made myself eat it all, shortly after went into a lobster coma and it was worth it. 

After dinner they gave us the complimentary kitchen and wine cellar tour. Very neat! We were trying to stall and settle our food so that we could go to the dessert room lol! The dessert room is a must!!! Super romantic and private and anything you order will be delicious!

HvZ5vJUP028B04Sbd3RB7Q,mNM9ITg780AnsPThtp9wFg,5,51,"Past time for an updated review to reflect all the positive changes that this bagel emporium has gone through over the last few years. 

Biggest visible change was the expansion of their footprint and reorientation of the shop to permit side of building access which greatly enhances the size and feel of the space. Now Keystone is a for real cafe, with table and wall seating all around which gives a spaciousness to the operation.

Most important, they have built a bagel bakery right into the shop, with windows allowing customers to see the bagelmeisters at work. Not having to transport them from a more distant location means that the bagels are apex quality right from the oven to the bins. Nothing is lost in taste nor texture when the overall distance is about 20 feet. The difference in chewability is immediately apparent. Crisp firm outer skin and soft tender inner bagel, and full load of toppings (onion flakes for me), that stay affixed to the rounder, and don't fall off with normal handling. 

Service was excellent all around, with ordering at the counter and delivery to the table when done. Take out seemed just as smooth as I watched people come and go quickly. 

Keystone is planning an expansion into other shops and considering franchising the business. From what I saw and experienced on my last visit, they have a thoughtful plan and the means to execute. They listen to customers and are flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions. Personally, I would love to see them open up a little farther north in Bucks, and look into cross marketing with local coffee roasters where the best local Java and rounders were available in the same places and advertised together. 

The current situation is impressive, I suspect it will only get better from here!

Once inside you are treated to a true sensory delight aesthetically. Referred to as Steampunk Design, it combines machinery and elegance, offering lots of textures to carry your eyes from the floor to the ceiling. Atmosphere evokes a rustic southern charm, which I find to be very inviting and comfortable.  

The entire evening ran fabulously well. We were seated immediately on this Wednesday evening. Our server popped right over to say hi, offer a bit of welcomed conversation and get us started on cocktails. BTW, he was spot on all night. Knowledgeable about all things on the menu and I ask lots of questions. I was so impressed.  The drink menu is phenomenal and is fun to peruse. A bit pricey for a neighborhood restaurant. I tried the beautiful bright pink Tahona and my friend mentioned the Old Fashioned was executed well. I was lucky enough to be offered a sip . Wow, I think I just found a new fave cocktail. We ordered wine, however the list was a bit limited. Our server mentioned they were in the process of updating this section. I hope they include price points that are more drinker friendly ! 

The menu is as chef, Ted Dorsey, calls it  ""Americana with a Southern touch and a French Creole twist."" This evening we started with Pimento Crab Corn Fritters and Grilled Octopus. Both were fantastic, with the octopus being a standout! I'd like another order now please ! Delicious ! Next up the Seared Diver Scallops (cooked perfectly and I absolutely loved the carrot ribbons on top) and the Rubbed Corn Flake Seared Tuna .  He said it was good. The finale was the Mill Mudslide (a Flourless Chocolate Cake, Chocolate Coffee Cream, Bailey's Mousse). I usually never order chocolate. I will never say never again. This was divine ! I could go back in just for this alone. We had leftovers and I was fortunate enough to get them all ! What a fantastic lunch I had the next day.   

I am thrilled to say The Mill now offers Happy Hour !!!! Beer is $5.00, Wine is $6.00 and Cocktails $7.00 . Bar Bites are $6-$13.00. Happy Hour is Tuesday-Friday from 4-7 !

This was my first visit to this South Tampa establishment, which has been all the rage since its opening about a month ago. I was so excited to come give it a go. 

I was here at an off time on a Sunday afternoon. This is the scene. They make it simple.  Walk in grab a menu. You choose 2 bases ... white rice, brown rice, kale cabbage slaw or a power blend of greens. Next choose either the 2 scoop or 3 scoop protein. Now choose from a variety of mix- in's like cilantro or green onion, etc. Next choose a marinade. Finally wrap it up with a sauce  and from a huge selection of toppings (Like 20-25). Get one or get all. It is your choice and they are included in the price of the bowl. My bowl consisted of the veggie bases, no rice, tuna and salmon, cilantro, jalapeno, green onion and the sriracha. My toppings were mango, radish cucumber, ginger, seaweed and avocado. They have a lot of other more progressive toppings. I had my sauces put on the side. I was glad I did because I never used them once I got home. Perhaps If I had gotten the rice I would have. My bowl did not need anything else. It was flat out full of flavor fantastic!

You get to create the bowl. Please pay attention to the person making your bowl. Tell the person if you want more of something. I told this awesome girl lots more cilantro, pour on the jalapeno's, more sriracha please,no more onion etc. They will gladly customize your bowl. I went with the regular size and it was perfect. This is mainly a to-go spot, although they have a few seats. They have fresh juices and fresh flavored waters.

ZVBiY0FTtoy65YHtMMEoGA,3Ym00dQ_oqZ0zunGMLhX3Q,5,91,"Prasino, he said ...

Best in St. Charles, he said ...

He just might be right ... 

So, I'm rounding up from 4 stars to 5 ... because he said so.

The best drink to warm up to Prasino is no longer on the menu. So, ask for it by name because the spicy jalapeno-infused ""Little Heat from Mexico"" cocktail is a hot way to start. If spicy alcohol isn't your thing, then you can't go wrong with a classic Negroni or a Vodka Smash (ask for light ice); however, my other recommendation is a smoky ""Fire at Rickhouse"" Cocktail with Buffalo Trace Bourbon served at the table in a smoked glass.

For appetizers, I have three recommendations and, in this order:

 * Shrimp Tacos
Thinking about tacos or shrimp in Missouri makes my head hurt, so, don't and get a trio of these crazy-addictive soft shrimp tacos that are meant to be shared, but won't be because they're that good.

 * Wood Fire Grilled Wings
These wings taste healthier because Prasino isn't joking about using a wood-fired grill with extra charcoal tips for flavor.

 * Cheese Farm Flatbread
The cheese blend isn't special, but a dash of chives and truffle honey ... yep, it's really all about the truffle honey, honey ... make this a cool twist on your kid's favorite.

And onto the main entrees of which I've only tried a couple. My family likes the Prasino Burger or Turkey Burger or just more of the Shrimp Tacos. For me, these were worth trying:

 * St. Louis Pork Steak
How could I pass up ordering this local legend that features a THICK cut of pork topped with Fitz Root Beer BBQ Sauce plus a Jalapeño Corn Biscuit and Crisp Apple Slaw? I couldn't.

 * Short Ribs with Sweet Wine Risotto 
Even better was a meaty serving of tender rib meat floating on Swiss Chard, Cauliflower Gratin, and Truffle-Mushroom Cabernet Sauce.

The food was good and the drinks better; however, the service was the best. I don't know the name of our server, but he's cool and had spot-on recommendations. Prasino was packed, yet, he helped us feel special.

He said Prasino. He said best in St. Charles. He just might be right.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c19f54dc13e8c0dedd7""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Restaurants, American (New), Bars, Nightlife"",""business_id"":""3Ym00dQ_oqZ0zunGMLhX3Q"",""name"":""Prasino""}]"
TBOocUJnZ_lFL5-pNOXzUQ,T9fF2OXS7FObKpmaxTGXVw,5,59,"I did NOT want to like this place when I have always visited roadside stands for crab boils-- & saved money. HOWEVER, the seafood & the service here were simply IMPECCABLE! Both made the rather hearty bill worth it! 

Remember to check in; currently you'll receive a free beer or a free glass of wine or 1/2 off an appetizer. (We requested 10% off our bill instead & the manager was kind enough to oblige.)

I am NOT a fried foods person, yet the Fried Calamari appetizer for just under $9 was EXCELLENT. The batter was beautifully light. The Calamari was tender & flavorful-- I especially loved the legs. It was the best Calamari I've ever tried. 

The Snow Crab/Shrimp/Lobster Tail boil w/ potato & corn @ $33.95 was also the BEST I've ever eaten. I requested a combination of Garlic Butter & Creole (Aka Mr. & Mrs. Crab seasoning). The combination was UNBELIEVABLY DELICIOUS. My date's one pound of Snow Crab Legs & $25.95 was spot on! He also enjoyed the Creole Fries ($4.95) & Cheesecake w/ Cherries & Whipped Topping (also $4.95). 

There are 12 appetizers on the menu, as well as soups & salads. There are 3 Combination entrees-- mine was one of them. There are also ""Make Your Own Seafood Combo"" meals, as well as 8 fried offerings. 

5 spice levels & 5 seasonings are available--  mix & match the seasonings, if you wish. (I am SO glad I did!)

Service provided by ""Jay"" was PHENOMENAL; she was genuinely friendly, attentive, & helpful. In fact, each staff member whom we encountered as we walked to & from our table was personable-- such a great first impression! 

The restaurant was clean. The bibs, extra napkins, hand wipes, & handled take-home paper bags w/ plastic interior bags were appreciated. 

Tables, booths, & some wall TVs (among a slightly tacky & overly busy marine decor) create a casual & comfortable atmosphere. This is not a fancy establishment, but it's a quality one. 

I will DEFINITELY return after recommending Mr. & Mrs. Crab to my family & friends. Kudos to the business owner, management, & staff on a job VERY WELL DONE.

98EpM5W7_j22NRm4u5r0iA,zCELc_Vqc0EbnTwbkpUIEA,5,73,"If a Chinese girl told you this is one of the best Chinese joints in Jersey, are you willing to believe her? If yes, then continue on my friend!

Oh wow... you have a lot of faith in me. 

Let me start by saying there's a loyal fan base for Joe's and for a very good reason. While it's nothing fancy shmancy on the inside, it's a great spot to sit comfortably, sip some tea, and stuff your face with delicious, great quality Chinese food. All for a very reasonable price too. If you're lucky, you'll catch Joe himself making his rounds and greeting all of his patrons, especially the loyal ones that keep coming back. Oh yes, there was many of them. 

If you're a newbie here, go for Joe's specialities. You guessed it... the duck! Joe cleverly put together set menus for parties of all sizes which include duck, fried rice, wonton soup, and additional dishes depending on which set menu you order. A great bargain if you're rolling deep and feel like enjoying a delicious duck meal family style. The way any traditional Chinese meal should be enjoyed.

It was a chilly rainy night when we visited so we went with something different, the wonton and duck egg noodle soup. The bowl arrived piping hot with al dente egg noodles, flavorful wontons, and tender, fatty duck. As expected from traditional Chinese broths, it was light and mild, allowing me to spice it up with their hot chili oil. Best of all, the broth had plenty of roasted duck flavor. So even after we devoured all of the duck, we still enjoyed the delicious smoky flavor in spoonfuls of broth. My mouth waters just thinking back to it. 

Another one of Joe's specialities that came highly recommended is the spicy szechuan beef udon noodles. It's unbelievably good. Every bite was saucy, spicy, peppery, and overall flavorful. While it's listed as a soup noodle, the light, clear broth is actually served separate from the noodles and used as a palette cleanser. I was skeptical of the broth at first, but it turned out to be extremely satisfying in between all of the slurp-slurp action. Yes, definitely get this. 

For me, the most surprising aspect of Joe's was how good they make ""American Chinese"" food. We decided on an order of the grandfather chicken, which was essentially their version of general tso's. What a fantastic dish. For once, there was more meat than breading and best of all, it was all tender white meat. Kinda unheard of nowadays. The portion was plentiful and the sauce was just right - thick, sweet, and spicy. The best general tso's I've ever had! 

If you've made it this far into my novel on how much I love Joe's, then I'm sure you're already contemplating a visit. Like Nike... JUST DO IT.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0dfec1""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Chinese, Restaurants"",""business_id"":""zCELc_Vqc0EbnTwbkpUIEA"",""name"":""Joe's Peking Duck House""}]"
mdOcmse9rz71nA1wxsWSMw,sankqYOVWpYX_T5kGZRRKQ,5,69,"For me, 4.5 stars, but when low prices & diligent servers are factored in (especially after reopening), FIVE stars seems fair. 

This restaurant has been in my ""Must Try"" Collection for at least a year. It has averaged 4.5 stars the entire time, which was my incentive to stop in today. (The low prices are welcomed when feeding my size 0 daughter who regularly orders two full breakfast entrees, as she did today.)

The restaurant is located in a strip mall on Florida Ave not too far from Bearss Ave & I-275. There are approximately 3 outside metal tables, & 14 interior tables on site. While we were there, two young male servers handled the dining room & checkout. Both were friendly & helpful-- just down-to-earth guys. This is the first restaurant I've ever visited where every photo/picture on the wall is not only level, but evenly spaced. Fascinating. 

Our wonderful server Cameron did have a couple of missteps, but he immediately took ownership of them, which was impressive. My rye toast turned into delicious raisin bread toast, & my side of VERY tasty ham became four strips of excellent bacon. (I kept the toast, but did request the ham.) Cameron even boxed up our vast leftovers. 

Our food was very good, while the Banana Caramel Nut French Toast (@ $8.95) will be calling my name for YEARS to come (even though I got just two small bites of it:) Yes, it's A MUST TRY whenever you drop by! (See the pic for induced drooling, & notice the rhyme:)

From the Vegetable Omlet to my One Egg Breakfast, we were more than satisfied. Oh, & don't pass on the Home Fries-- basically a soft, thin kettle chip that's DELICIOUS w/ ketchup! (My dad made them for us girls as kids-- I appreciated the nostalgia.)

This is a great little breakfast & brunch cafe offering breakfast foods & lunch daily (w/ the exception of Tuesday). One of the interior signs mentions that Shelly's Chicken Sandwich is ""better than Popeye's & Everyone Else's.""

mU97izc00GPtVuTF6-eV7Q,3iUCCf1FWmjlFbGYvBgf9w,5,124,"What a fun place!  I stumbled into a lot of joints over the course of three days and Martin's was hands down my favorite experience. The atmosphere here is amazing. It feels as though you're in a friend's gigantic barn that has live music on the stage, BBQ and no shortage of cold beer. This place is huge so there was plenty of space despite it being a busy Saturday night. Compared to many of the other places I visited, this was a big upside. It's all communal seating at picnic tables (upstairs at least), but that's part of the fun. There are at least two bars on the second floor and a separate counter for ordering food. Despite long lines at the first floor counter, I experienced no wait either time on the second floor. 

I had to good fortune of catching the James Carothors band while here and they were absolutely phenomenal. If you like the old school Waylon, Willie, Charlie Daniels type stuff, I highly recommend trying to catch their show. The atmosphere was absolutely electric as these guys completely nailed classic hit after hit. Whether you choose to scoot a boot or sit back with a beer and some BBQ, this place cannot be beat. 

For me the food wasn't quite as memorable as the rest of the experience, but there were definitely no negatives either. Having had an overindulgence of BBQ in TX the week prior (I honestly didn't think it was possible), I opted for something a little different in the fried bologna sandwich. The bologna is thick cut (probably 1/2 an inch), seared on each side and served with mustard and pickles. I'm glad I tried it, but would not order it again (too much bologna for me). The chicken wings were delicious and the hush puppies were so good that I went back for a second order. 

If you want to experience what I consider to be country in its truest form, Martin's is the place. I was throughly impressed with everything and had absolutely the best time here.

Reservations are required, but if you happen to show up without one, then you can put your name on the waitlist to see if anything becomes available. I believe there is a 2 hour time limit when dining here so keep that in mind. 

We started with a variety of appetizers such as the hummus, tabbouli, halloumi cheese with watermelon, cheese sambosik, and pita bread. Between the 7 of us in our party, it was more than enough to get us started. Everything was delicious!

I especially enjoyed the halloumi cheese! I've never had an appetizer like this. I keep wondering how they managed to cut watermelon slices into squares lol. The cheese had a nice texture and wasn't too salty, so the olives paired well making this app a slightly sweet and salty treat. 

For drinks, the majority of us opted for the Spring Fling. This drink was the best cucumber drink I've ever had! It was refreshing and not too sweet. I loved it! 

My main entrée was the lemon chicken with a creamy lemon butter sauce, and rice pilaf. The sauce brought this meal to life with its buttery richness. It also comes with a side salad which has a nice tangy dressing. 

I was able to sample my friends salmon, and it was perfectly cooked. The basil cream sauce was a nice compliment to this dish. 

Customer service here was excellent! We didn't have to wait long for anything. They were constantly checking on us. Even the food was brought out quickly! I was very impressed. Maybe it's due to the time limit, but we didn't feel rushed at all.

I stumbled upon this wonderful place while in Santa Barbara and I'm so happy I did. They have every dish of Mexican food you can think of nachos, burritos, tacos, and more--conscious Mexican food that is. Let's discover one of the many especials. The restaurant space is small but the food quality makes up for it as it's delicious and nutritious.

I ordered the tacos which comes with three total. To begin, one must choose a carb, meatless protein, and fixings. I ordered the barbacoa (gluten free) which is the jackfruit and they are quite generous on the guacamole servings I had added--see photo. I took a bite and it was amazing! (Ohh, I have a little guac on my mouth lol seriousLY.) The salsa was a very nice touch. Everything was so fresh, vibrant in color and they even have kombucha on tap! I had the pineapple kombucha with a hint of the hemp milk horchata that I enjoyed (fermented anything is good for the gut and building stomach acid).

I appreciate that everything is authentic and made from scratch in-house. Friendly vibes. Next time, I look forward to trying the burrito, vegan bowl, or the nachos--I bet those are very especial also! I want to try everything since everything is...

To my surprise this is a hidden gem in the Dunedin area (newly opened about 10 months by a local extremely talented Chef)

Owners Erin ""Cricket"" Plunkett, 26, and Jason Borajkiewicz, 34 have certainly captured the essence of Modern European cooking. The dishes are not really large but very fresh, delicious and well prepared. For a party of 2 you can drop about $75 -$100 - but believe me its quality over quantity. You can taste the love and attention to detail in each dish. The menu changes 2 to 3 times a week to allow for fresh and creative dishes. So the menu is short in my book is a good sign because that allows for everything to be fresh. And they have the flexibility to make frequent changes. We should all be mindful of the restaurants offering pages of dishes and what are we really receiving...hhhmmm how fresh, frozen, in microwavable portions are we paying for. (Message...LOL) :)

The bathroom is very very clean, the interior of the restaurant was artful and again very clean. 

I had the wagyu beef cheek for 2, roasted vegetables, thyme jus...and it was yummilicious it is the pic in my check-in photo - when I say the favorites were very tasty and tender you can cut with your fork or butter knife.

The desserts in my book can be bigger for sure. I had the basil semifreddo, lemon curd, strawberry, candied ginger. Very Tasty  

I'll be back again for sure - oh there are closed on Saturdays and Sundays...but believe me well worth the weekday trip

Walk-ins only (no reservations) - hours...Monday-Friday...lunch 12pm - 2pm and dinner 5pm - 9pm

21maIKYLZL1xgZ07Hp7zLQ,HUJLxKMVmUvreA-07qUitg,5,57,"So many of the good Mexican houses are across the Bucks County line in Montco, and Don Chile Mexican Restaurant is yet another of them. 

I called in my order of Chicken Cheese Flautas and Tacos al Pastor, and it was ready 15 minutes later. The space was attractive, and I can see eating in when the Covid coast is clear. The woman handling the front of the house was friendly, efficient and attractive. She made me feel appreciated for giving them my business. 

When I returned home, I found nice sized portions of everything, including bags/containers of chips & salsa, red rice, silky refried beans and crema fresca. The three Flautas were six inches long and overstuffed with chunky semi- ground roast chicken and white cheese wrapped in a large wheat tortilla and fried to a pleasant crisp. I topped that with their gaucamole, lettuce and tomato. A final drizzle of queso fresca over everything, and I was a contented man. 

My beautiful opposite number went after the Al Pastor with the same gusto, and described succulent roast pork surrounded by pieces of grilled pineapple, lettuce, tomato, guac and cheese; crammed into 3 smaller tortillas she could barely pinch and roll closed to get into her boca pequena bonita. She was hungry and didn't give me a chance to take photos before she demolished them. They sure had great aroma. 

Even the rice and beans were exceptional and worthy of mention. The grains were freshly made and not clumpy nor tasting of reheating, and the refried mashed kidney beans surprisingly smooth and delicious. All without the heartburn normally associated with heavy application of lard. No Tums necessary. 

Don Chile isn't in or near my neighborhood, but certainly is worth a drive in the country when the Mexican mood strikes. 

Mucho gusto!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c19f54dc13e8c0defc6""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Mexican"",""business_id"":""HUJLxKMVmUvreA-07qUitg"",""name"":""Don Chile Mexican Restaurant""}]"
VpDw-qOy8luOgVcRRuXF6A,BZyxr4ocl1hJvFvhlogz0Q,5,176,"I've been wanting to try this place forever. Yesterday was the day. I was just down the street, hungry and Sulphur Springs Sandwich Shop popped in my mind. So glad it did. I checked out the menu online, as advised by another reviewer, and called in a to-go order. It was so hard for me to choose because they have a great selection of creative sandwiches. In the end the BATT won. This has turkey salad( I subbed chicken salad) , bacon, avocado and tomato on toasted bread. This was for mom. This was fantastic! I'm so picky about my chicken salad and they sold me. Yes a reorder for sure. It was huge. We ended up splitting this for lunch. Such a worthy splurge.  Karen said go with the cucumber salad in her review. . Laura mentioned the potato salad. I ordered one of each and enjoyed both. Each sandwich comes with a side btw. I also ordered the beet, kale and goat cheese salad with seared tuna !!! I have yet to dive into that. It looks fantabulous and I can't wait for lunch. 

The staff is great. So kind to me. I asked them to call me when the order was ready, as mom was in the car.  I can't leave her too long in her condition, nor is it easy to take her out of the car. They offered to bring it to me. How sweet is that? Extra points. 

The shop is directly across the street from Home Depot. I mention this to help you locate it easily. It is sandwiched in-between a strip club and a massage parlor. Lol. They have about ten tables if you want to dine inside this humble restaurant. I bet during prime hours this place is rocking. I went at 1:30 so all was easy. Parking is not the best. Go anyway. Trust me ! You will be glad you did. I'll be driving out of my way for this place.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1cf54dc13e8c0e21e4""},""stars"":""5"",""categories"":""Sandwiches, Vegetarian, Delis, Cafes, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, Cuban, Salad, Food, Desserts"",""business_id"":""BZyxr4ocl1hJvFvhlogz0Q"",""name"":""Sulphur Springs ?Sandwiches Shop""}]"

cGOzanm9X3v7tBrkKhGPmA,dsfRniRgfbDjC8os848B6A,5,59,"I always have a terrific experience when dining at Bern's. I find people either love this place or hate it. No in between.  I am a lover of the atmosphere, which is dark, sultry and alive, the service, which is impeccable ( one of my favorite server's is Brian ) and the food. I usually order the Special Chateau or a piece of fish. All meals are served with soup, salad, veggies, potato and bread. It is rare to find a restaurant that does this anymore. I am able to get a delicious steak dinner for under $40.00!!!  They have the worlds largest wine list. 

Everything is made in-house. The dressings for the salads are awesome. I'm a fan of the blue cheese and the cilantro vinegarette. The bernaise sauce is divine. It is a nice addition to the steak, as is the mushroom brian. The french onion soup is to die for. I normally opt out of the potato and ask for extra veggies. It is a lot of food so I do not get appetizers . I have gotten the steak cobb salad for dinner before and it is great. On occasion I have been known to order the steak sandwich, which is not on the menu. It does hit the spot.

The dessert room is fun and is quite an experience. If you have not visited the upstairs room for sweet treats I suggest you do so. You will find yourself being seated in your own compartment. They do not serve dessert in the main dining rooms.

The bar is festive. The full menu is offered here. If you want to sit at the bar you will need to tell the bartender, as they sit folks here on a first come first serve basis. He keeps a running list. I believe his name is Mario. BTW, you will need reservations if you want table seating. They keep a hand full of tables open in the back for walk in's. In my experience they are gone by 6:30 and at that point you will have a two hour wait. This is where we sat last night.

This Tampa dining destination is worth every penny in my humble opinion.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1cf54dc13e8c0e1f7a""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Arts & Entertainment, Steakhouses, Restaurants"",""business_id"":""dsfRniRgfbDjC8os848B6A"",""name"":""Bern's Steak House""}]"
A0afbRcil2MIgqYa5dLgJg,i2BdYwl6daYX0ObRX14t1w,5,57,"Simply Delicious by Tina is the star of the culinary show on this stretch of York Road, Jamison, PA. Plenty of parking alongside the stand alone building, with a long ramp up to the main door, you walk into a small deli/cashier area. There you can scan some of the home cooked meals offered by Proprietress Tina and her crew, as well as a sampling of her tasty baked goods. 

The dining room is to the left, and bathed in bright sunlight on this Saturday morn. Only one table was occupied by a grandfather/granddaughter team, so I gamboled to the other side near the bar for my seat. Orders are taken at the register, so I returned there after perusing the two sided laminate menu. 

Lots of healthy choices, and I selected the Hungry Person Breakfast Sandwich (3 eggs, 3 small homemade sausages, American cheese, tomato, greens on toasted thick sliced brioche). It was so large upon delivery to me that I asked that it be cut in half so I would have a chance to pick it up and take a bite without it falling apart in my hands. 

Well, it sort of fell to pieces under pressure from the kitchen knife anyway, but it still looked great when it came back to me. It still wasn't possible to secure it by hand with all the slippery ingredients, so I went after it with knife and fork. I combined different elements on the tines of my fork and jammed each into my mouth, my jaws as wide open as possible. 

It was totally worth the effort.

The parts were as good as the whole. 

I took home a square of Tina's Key Lime Strawberry bar for later enjoyment. Just devoured that four hours later. Loved it! From moist graham cracker crust through tart creamy lime/cheese body, and hint of sweet strawberry, it was a pleasure all the way down. Hot coffee chaser to finish my excellent weekend early day repast.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e2e7d""},""stars"":""5"",""categories"":""Coffee & Tea, Juice Bars & Smoothies, Food, Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants"",""business_id"":""i2BdYwl6daYX0ObRX14t1w"",""name"":""Simply Delicious by Tina""}]"

Near Pier 60, park thru a metered spot on their lot or purchase a $1/hr parking spot from the restaurant hostess upstairs. Walk up to 2nd floor to build an appetite, or ride the elevator and burn it later.

Ambiance was casual and laid back with a picture perfect view of the Clearwater Beach. Our server was Phrank and he was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. Service was fast and efficient.

Got the Bairdi Crab with Shrimp Scampi and Stuffed Clams, with sides of Mac n Cheese plus Mashed Potatoes. Serving was big and quality was good. It had three quarter pounds of delectable crab legs steamed with butter and old bay seasoning, rich and creamy mac n cheese, and stuffed clams that were incredible and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were smooth and fluffy and the shrimp scampi was perfectly done. Crab Trap Bucket and All American Strawberry Vodka Lemonade Cocktails were both craftily mixed.

eDGxiioG3f2Ul2SmbJPzyQ,p_qSQwShIgQnNxGcajI4-w,5,84,"I loved everything about the Oxford Exchange. The restaurant is upbeat and the food is super fresh. Our dining experience was so relaxing and enjoyable that all of us felt as though we could have stayed all day. 

When we arrived the place was packed and yet we were seated at a perfect table. Our waiter showed up at the table with a secure top water cup for my grandson within seconds of sitting. He followed with rye toast and puréed raspberries to keep him occupied while we looked at the menu. 

We ordered Grouper Cheeks $13.00, Avocado Toast $13.00, Beef Tartare $17.00, Chicken Burger $15.00, Scrambled Eggs with Fruit $10.00, Benedict $17.00, French Toast $14.00 and 4 Mimosas. $40.00. 

Everything was amazing!! It would be difficult to pick a favorite. The grouper was so fresh and juicy that we could have ordered several small plates. The wagyu beef was incredibly tender and tasty. I loved the fresh crab on the Avocado Toast. My daughter thought that the Benedict was the best that she had. It was served with perfectly cooked eggs, smoked ham, collard greens and chipotle cheddar fondue on a sweet potato biscuit. The French Toast is made with strawberry swirled sourdough and has a sour cream drizzle. It is topped with pistachios and maple syrup.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c19f54dc13e8c0dee0c""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Restaurants, American (New), Coffee & Tea, Books, Mags, Music & Video, Breakfast & Brunch, Food, American (Traditional), Event Planning & Services, Bookstores, Cafes, Diners, Venues & Event Spaces, Shopping"",""business_id"":""p_qSQwShIgQnNxGcajI4-w"",""name"":""Oxford Exchange""}]"
BV2i5jcydx1BSa-qgc5UDA,UnBs9SfFGQ7TpE_3uYIqfg,5,56,"Came here for the first time for an anniversary dinner. Was not wowed by the decor of the place walking in, very rustic feeling. But I was wowed by the food and service! First I was told in advance to order the watermelon martini. I did not see it on the menu but the waiter said they do still make it. Pricey, $15 but It was the best martini I've ever had! They infuse the watermelon in the vodka for 3 days!! 

We did not order an appetizer but all entrees come with bread and a house salad. The bread was nothing special, just rolls with some herbs and shredded cheese baked on top. The salad was very delicious for just being a ""house salad"". It was elevated above the basic salad, really good and flavorful. 

For entrees my husband had the 24oz porterhouse steak. Man was it huge, and cooked just the way he likes it. I ordered the lobster tail (not knowing how big it would be) and it was 1lb!! My lord a 1lb lobster tail. I sadly could not finish it all! I even paid their charge of $5 to have truffle butter with it. Yummmm!! 
We had also ordered two shareable sides: the red skin garlic mashed potatoes and the creamed kale. Both also very good! There wasn't anything we didn't like. Sides were about $10 each for most but good size portions for sharing. 

We were both so full and did not have room for desert. Or another martini!!

It is hard to recommend any one menu item, as all are superb.  Troy, Colleen and staff will make it a memorable evening.    From birthday's, anniversary's to job promotions we always went to LuLou's to celebrate.    We still have the special celebration menus they made for us.

We now live in Seattle Wa, and while we are enjoying some great places up here, we long for a friday night at LuLou's.  We make it a point to go back to Reno at least once a year.  If for no other reason than to enjoy LuLou's.

As our adventure begins with locating a parking spot. Truly, parking is a mess here, this little shop is located in the downtown area of Tucson. It's a hop away from the university. It's worth the extra time that you will spend to gain access here. Parking in most areas is always free, but this could change. When I have visited, parking is still free. 
 
Now all parked and out of the truck, let's go! Shall we explore what Woops has to offer. Aside from macaroons they serve ""real food,"" here too. If your looking for a sandwich, cafe style with deli meats and cheeses on a fresh croissant let's do lunch. Besides macaroons, for us caffeine nuts they got ya! How about a matcha latte along side that box of macaroons. Prefer coffee it's all here brewed fresh whenever or whatever. Find your happy, then get ready to order. 

When ordering it can be done over the phone, in person, or from your social media app; Yelp. Their pricing is about average. What's average? A box of twelve macaroons will set you back around $24. This is a whole box. The macaroons are sold individually, but everything is cheaper by the dozen. Besides, who can eat just one or two macaroons? It seems I'm a creature of habit for when I find something that I like, theirs no chance of changing it. My drinks of choice are the cafe au lait and the matcha latte. Both are delicious with no added sweetener than what nature gives us . Their espressos shots are that smooth. The matcha latte has no after taste nor bitterness. In fact, they ask every time if you want sweetener in your matcha or coffee beverage. 

Prior to COVID, I cannot report how the business was handled. After COVID, the store is always clean, friendly, and merry. The lobby of this little cafe holds around two to three tables inside and a few outside seating areas. They are always clean and sanitized. The staff makes it their mission to immediately greet every guest with a genuine smile and warmth. Every time I visit here the merriment of the employees makes any unhappiness melt away. What's not to love? The ambiance of the store cries out to all. It's a call if you listen, deep in your soul. Good individuals gather and are employed here. Come and celebrate with coffee lattes and macaroons always. 

The owner of Woops is always kind. Her employees feel like family. The store is so inviting, it's worth a pop in just to see. If you ever have a few moments, come on by! The macaroons are delicious and oh so excellent. The coffee is in demand and always fresh. Find happiness wherever your heart takes you! For great eats and some fun make new memories. Come and explore the down town Tucson area. Stop in for that cup of joy to keep the days events rolling along smoothly. Make new memories and stops along the way. Explore new paths along the journey.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c19f54dc13e8c0df009""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Food, Coffee & Tea, Desserts, Specialty Food, Bakeries, Macarons, Cafes"",""business_id"":""4kTeF5mHEkXzO-q1sxHZ2A"",""name"":""Woops!

2O0o6HcfpC2HLutQeATNIw,WrZaL6BxHqVqt3sAcJ-5Rg,5,77,"Bluebeard is an Indianapolis American restaurant located near the hustle and bustle of downtown Indy.  

My family and I were in town and down the street at the convention center as my daughter had a huge cheer comp. Saturday after she finished day one of performing wee arrived to this establishment at around 240pm. 

Very small and cozy inside. Not much seating. We were the only visitors at the time and were told ""no worries but the kitchen closes in 20 min"". We assured them we are fast decision makers and shouldn't be a problem. 

The decor here on the inside is very sleek and quaint. On the outside you have some really cool murals. Including one in the rear of a face tatted Dolly Parton with her hit songs. Yes you read that right. And yes it is glorious. 

We placed our order fairly quickly. The menu said lunch but most options were breakfast food. So maybe this is a brunch place primarily (maybe just  on Saturday)?  We are fine with that though as we are the type who will eat breakfast for dinner by choice. So no biggie. 

My two daughters with us (are 11 and 1 year old) split a grilled cheese and spaghetti. The grilled cheese looked very visually pleasing. So of course I sampled it. And it was tastefully pleasing as well. Good sandwich. The spaghetti was interesting. Neither kid cared for it. Me and the wife tried it and it is good. But very unique in that it has like a lemon flavor to it. So I can see where kids expecting traditional spaghetti may turn there noses up at this item. 

My wife order the big a** B&G (biscuit and gravy with and egg) and a side of Brussels sprouts. Weird combo right? She 9 months pregnant so we will let her slide. Anyways, she loved both. Said both top notch. The Brussels sprouts side was in a huge bowl and enough to feed a person alone. 

I personally  got the quesadilla which once again was breakfast style only. Egg and chorizo. I will say it is by far the best breakfast quesadilla I've ever had. Nice and cheesy and just a great taste. 

Overall we had a wonderful experience. Great food and our server was super kind and recognized my daughter was in town for a cheer comp and really hyped her up and cheered on her success. Which made her feel good! My only complaint is something that if you don't read the small print on the menu you wouldn't know about. They charge an automatic 5 percent Kitchen gratuity. Very strange and I've never had a place do that before. Something so unique and obscure I'd really like to see signs posted on larger lettering. I fear that people would get angry about feeling bamboozled and it may cause someone to take it out of a waiter/waitress tip which wouldn't be fair to them. Outside of that this is a 5 star experience for us and we were very satisfied.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c19f54dc13e8c0def9d""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Restaurants, American (New), Venues & Event Spaces, Event Planning & Services"",""business_id"":""WrZaL6BxHqVqt3sAcJ-5Rg"",""name"":""Bluebeard""}]"

It is amazing what they have done with the old space, they have transformed it into a stylish and welcoming restaurant - it must have been an enormous amount of work. Flames is a little higher end than other Indian restaurants in the area and the food and decor reflect that.

The meal was excellent. We started off with some perfectly made mango lassis, which our kids devoured, and then we had one of the dal and one of the chicken dishes, both of which were very good. We're looking forward to exploring the rest of the menu as they have a good variety.

While we were eating one of the owners and his wife came by to ask how everything was, they were obviously excited to be opening the restaurant (I can't imagine the amount of work that has gone into it) and asked for our feedback on the menu and service.

On Mother's Day, I didn't want to cook dinner. My husband said I could have anything I wanted for dinner. I requested Indian food even though he hates it. 

I ordered via ubereats. They were fast in preparing the food, and everything arrived hot and fresh.

I started with the vegetable samosas. They were crispy but not oily. They were excellent with the mint cilantro sauce. 

The lamb biriyani was excellent.  Well seasoned,  generous amount of boneless tender meat.   I ate myfill, then had enough for breakfast the next day and a couple servings for my toddler who loved it too!

I called to make a reservation for a Thursday night given that we would have a party of 8 for my mom's birthday. I'm so glad I thought of that ahead of time as when we arrived the parking lot was full as was the restaurant.  We were seated within a few minutes of arriving and greeted by a server to take drink orders almost immediately.  We ordered the mixed vegetable pakora, vegetable platter, chicken tikka, and tiranga chicken for appetizers.  The tiranga chicken was by far my favorite dish here and all of the chicken dishes were tender and well seasoned.  For our main courses that we shared family style we had the butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, dak makhani, baigan bhartha, and chana masala.  Again the quality of the ingredients and flavors were spot on and no one had a bad thing to say.  The garlic naan was also cooked well and served fresh.

Throughout our meal we were checked on by multiple members of the wait staff who were also dealing with a pretty full restaurant all evening.  The owner/manager even made his way over to check on us multiple times, which was a good touch.  He mentioned it has only been 7 weeks since opening and they will be starting lunch service soon.  It also appears a liquor license is still in the works, but people were byob and the restaurant didn't seem to mind.  One thing to note is that the décor was also very updated and fresh, which can be a sore spot for many Indian restaurants in the area but not this place.  The restaurant is also on Uber Eats, so takeout and delivery is another option if you are wanting to try this place.  I have some pretty picky eaters in my family and it was refreshing to see that all of them enjoyed our meal at Flames.

I sometimes feel I'm a creature of habit when it comes to ordering food I am less familiar with, the lamb curry was amazing as was the butter chicken which I managed to steal a taste of.

I met up with some fellow Yelpers to eat here... and we were seated immediately upon arrival, even without reservations. Drinks arrived quickly, as did some complimentary Papadum and Chutney, really tasty.

 After we figured out what we wanted (menu is very diverse, lots of good options), we placed our orders. 

One nice thing is that we were asked about Spice Levels, as in HOW HOT do you want it! That made it easier for everyone to get what they wanted (my advice would be to order one level hotter than what it sounds like... Normal medium? Get HOT! Not quite as spicy as I had hoped, although very tasty!)

I chose the Sag Lamb, a wonderful dish of Spinach, yogurt and Lamb all stewed together. It was delicious. My girlfriend got the Chicken Khorma, one of her favorites anywhere we go... and she really enjoyed it.  We did share a little with everyone at the table, and they shared with us too... so I got to try the Lamb Kafta (lamb meatballs in sauce) and it was very good. The Samosas, Pakora, and Onion Bhaji were yummy too. I did not have any of the Naan, although it looked and smelled wonderful... since I am trying to cut carbs. Maybe next time.. it got rave reviews.

The owner stopped by, and was very helpful and friendly... and he is excited about introducing Flames to a wider Yelp audience!

Chris the owner was pretty busy when we arrived and even busier throughout the day but he kindly took our order and brought the roll to us next door once it was ready.

Happy Hour is everyday Mon-Sun from 3-6 pm! The location is right across the street from East Beach and offers a nice inside bar area and outside patio area as well with views of our beautiful beach surrounded by palm trees. 

The happy hour menu offers $5 cocktails, wine, and beer. These are great prices! Especially for the location. On my latest visit I tried their spicy margarita which really isn't spicy but the rim is salted with a spicy chile salt. Maybe Tajin? In any case it was really good and didn't taste cheap at all.

Some of the other drinks offered on the menu are: 

- Pinot Noir (2015 Canyon Rd)
- Chardonnay (2015 Ballard Ln)
- Cab Sauvignon (2014 Ballard Ln)
- Brut Sparkling Rosé (Wycliff)
- Longhammer IPA, Redhook
- Lager, Dos XX
- Orange Pale Ale, Sierra Nevada 
- Lager, Amstel light 
- Convivo Spritzer 
- Sangria 

The food menu is just as great with $5 apps and $8 wood oven pizzas. So far I've tried the polpette (lamb meatballs) which are flavorful and delicious served with a hummus sauce. The Coxinhas (chicken & fontina croquettes) were amazeballs! These seem to be a popular item to order as I seen them on everyone's table. Highly recommend you try them. The spicy soppressata salami pizza was a full sized pizza for only $8! It does have a spicy kick to it but in a good way. The fennel sausage pizza looked really good as I was eyeballing the people sitting across from us devour it. I'll definitely order that one next time! 

A special shout out to Juan who was our server and did an excellent job tending to us. It's always good to have a nice attentive waiter with a sense of humor. 

This is definitely a place worth checking out if you haven't already!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1bf54dc13e8c0e10c6""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Bars, Mediterranean, Restaurants, Nightlife, Moroccan, Event Planning & Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Italian"",""business_id"":""Qkg16mN-8QR66gjzg6gMyw"",""name"":""Convivo Restaurant and Bar""}]"
RyzPFMdGjzrojOD-JnKp-g,ZhEJ98pvDE0E5DFyIQBAGg,5,55,"You can tell that folks in the Newtown, Bucks County, PA, area were hungry for great pizza, because Vince's Pizzeria and Taproom was absolutely jammed at 4:30 on the weekday afternoon I stopped in to check it out. There was hardly an empty parking space to be found. 

And, I understand why. Our region has a load of pizza shops, but extremely few that really know the pizza business (read, none). The people behind Vince's have several generations invested in making superlative dough and sauce, and using quality cheeses to create exceptional pies. Only the sainted DeLorenzo's transplanted from Jersey compares. 

Luckily for me, there was room at one of the large community tables in the back of the house. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. We ended up in extended conversations as we chowed down. There was a couple from Yardley, and another from Trenton, NJ. We were all there to sample the wares, and drink from the fountain of beers along the rear wall. It worked fairly well, although it was obvious that they were still on their shakedown cruise, this being their first week in operation. 

The taproom concept is still new and not readily available. It requires the purchase of a RFID chipped card that attaches above the tap to the beer selected, releasing the brew into 12 oz. glasses which are filled by the customer. The available inventory is pictured above each tap, with brief description to help you choose. The beer card is good for 32 oz., after which you must pay for a reinfusion of funds. It all gets a bit complicated, as it seemed that the staff was repeated asking for a credit card for that, and again at check out. I handed mine over three times - there should be a better system in place. 

Yet, all is forgiven because the tomato pie/pizza is so damn good! The crust is thin, but stays firm from first munch to last. No drooping points here. The taste is like a first rate cracker, with a little saltiness that offsets the mild sweetness of the sauce above. There is just the right ratio of red to white, so there is no excess run off from cheese oils, nor watery tomatoes. From first steaming bite to last cool belly filler, the consistency is constant with crunchy crust and easily distinguishable ingredients. These are high quality pies. 

All  I can say is that the other pizza joints in and around Newtown are in trouble now. The competition just jumped up a few notches. Once word gets out that Vince's is the new sheriff in town, the old boys will find themselves out of luck, and will have to improve their game if they want to stay in business. 

It's about time!  Thank you, Vince's!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1bf54dc13e8c0e0bdd""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Bars, Nightlife, Restaurants, Beer Bar, Pizza"",""business_id"":""ZhEJ98pvDE0E5DFyIQBAGg"",""name"":""Vince's Pizzeria and Taproom""}]"
rWFVUhLT-d2TUKHU-Hmtbg,vb2XWr50QhBpcOtpzxmKWA,5,65,"One door closes. Another door opens.  

I drove to Glenside for breakfast at a well known diner close by the Keswick Theater. The doors were locked and lights off on a midweek morning, and no notice posted that it was closed for vacation, or for good? Having come that far, I checked Yelp for an alternative kitchen in the neighborhood. It showed me Welcome Home, a cafe about two miles away in Jenkintown. 

I arrived there and found meter parking around the corner for $.50 for an hour. 

This is a small cubby hole of a breakfast/lunch joint. 8 deuce tables at most. Walking in, I was greeted warmly by a lovely woman, who exclaimed, ""Welcome Home."" She immediately warmed my heart with her salutation. I sat in the back of the dining room, right in front of the glass partition with the kitchen. I was handed their small menu, followed quickly by a mugga joe. It was hot and brisk. I inquired about the French Toast Casserole. Learning that it was very sweet, and asked that it be less so. She said that could be done, and a few moments later, I had a three inch high stack of Texas Toast that had been well dipped in a egg/sugar/cinnamon/vanilla slurry and pan fried/assembled into one united structure. Strawberries and cream on top. 

Yes. It was delicious from top to bottom, and even the accompanying sausage links played their second fiddle role well. I came in joneszing for sweet fried bread, and was completely satisfied. 

Welcome Home is Black Woman owned and operated by Stephanie, who is the guiding light and creative force. Her personality dominates the proceedings in a great way. The combination of character and kitchen magic makes this place a keeper and highly worthy of your exploration. Be sure to bring hungry taste buds.

But for living in Bucks County, I would make Welcome Home a true and regular stop on my breakfast trail. It is that unique and appealing.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e2642""},""stars"":""5"",""categories"":""Juice Bars & Smoothies, Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants, Cafes, Food"",""business_id"":""vb2XWr50QhBpcOtpzxmKWA"",""name"":""Welcome Home Cafe""}]"

pzCd-W1U9oMRUM9J0jeM7A,hlb7WwqcCijqqbp8zye1dw,5,114,"Noemi's pizza has definitely brought a whole new type of pizza that you will not find anyplace else here in town! For one, it is not your typical style Neapolitan thin pizza cooked in a circle shape. Noemi's pizza is cooked in a rectangular tray, and the crust is thick, but still remains very light, crispy, and airy. It reminded me of a focaccia type bread, but still very different. From what I've read and heard is that the dough is fermented for up to 96 hours so that is why it is so unique.

They serve pizza by the slice here with over 10 choices to choose from or you can customize your own. I chose 3 slices since I wanted to try a variety on their menu. It was a WOW factor when I opened the box to take a peek at the slices! I honestly didn't expect them to be so huge, and in no way am I complaining. It was definitely worth the price I paid! I was able to slice them in half, so I ended up with 6 slices. 

They all tasted amazing! Not greasy or too cheesy. Just the right amount of toppings, sauce, and cheese to my liking. 

Take and Bake pizza is also available, which offers a tray size of small (3 slices) or large (6 slices), red, white, or grape tomato sauce, and toppings. 

The lunch special here is very reasonable for $8.95, which includes one slice, small house salad, and soda. Or you can choose a cheese slice, small house salad, or soda for $7.95.

They do not offer gluten free pizza, but maybe they will eventually. However they do offer vegan pizza.

Due to COVID-19 they are offering take out or you can dine outside on their little patio area which includes a view of state street traffic.

Overall, I'm impressed by Noemi's pizza and I will definitely be back to try out the other delicious pizza choices that they offer.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c19f54dc13e8c0df265""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Pizza"",""business_id"":""hlb7WwqcCijqqbp8zye1dw"",""name"":""Noemi Pizza Romana""}]"
DEo-vqRS5KiCwt3ELQm0nQ,QLHgjBHBoeIUoEvIPvjHnw,5,78,"I've been looking forward to trying Mesa Burger ever since I heard it was led by Iron Chef Cat Cora. If you're lucky enough she will also bring the food to your table. Pretty cool to see her in person after watching her on the Food Network for many years.  

The Location is where Mexican Fresh Taqueria use to be if anyone is familiar with that area. They really did a great job in re-designing the whole place! It has a very beachy rustic feel to it. I like the open airy feel and the outside patio.  

I must admit when I first took a glance at the menu my first reaction was wow they are a bit pricey! But I didn't let that stop me from checking it out. I can honestly say after my burger experience here my meal was well worth the $16 I paid. So don't let the price detour you from trying this place. Give it a chance!

I went on my lunch break with my co-worker and we were greeted right away while waiting in line. I wish I would have gotten the name of the guy who was very kind and offered us a menu to look at while waiting in line. The whole staff was amazing and very attentive on our visit. Thank you guys! Keep up the great work. 

I decided to order the Funk Zone burger ($13) which comes with regular fries, but you can sub that with sweet potato waffle fries or onion rings for ($1) more. I decided to try the herb truffle & parmesan fries for ($2) more. 

My burger was amazing (10 stars)!! It was served with juices dripping from the burger stacked high with applewood smoked bacon. The bacon was to die for! I'm not a huge tomato person but the roasted tomatoes served on this burger were delicious. I didn't know where to start, do I cut this burger in half or do I just dive right into it? I went for it and just bit into the burger as much as I could since it was huge! Talk about a burgasmic experience. Hands down the best gourmet burger in town!!

The herb truffle & parm fries were delicious as well. At first glance it looked like a very small portion of fries served but I couldn't even finish them since the burger filled me up. My co-worker also enjoyed her meal and raved about the regular fries. She was happy I told her about mesa burger and is now a fan. 

It was nice to check out mesa burger and I look forward to going back to try the other burgers on the menu.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1df54dc13e8c0e276e""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""American (New), American (Traditional), Bars, Restaurants, Salad, Burgers, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Food, Nightlife, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Beer Bar, Chicken Shop"",""business_id"":""QLHgjBHBoeIUoEvIPvjHnw"",""name"":""Mesa Burger - Santa Barbara""}]"

Wondering why the long line outside, I whipped out my handy dandy Yelp app. Saw the awesome reviews and photos and told my companion...STOP the car, turn back, I'm going in. 

Due to COVID-19, only 4 are allowed inside at a time. I was disappointed to find only two flavors available in their glass counter and 3 on their chart. 

Here is what we chose on their limited menu on this Halloween day:
- Cinnamon Brown Sugar
- Strawberry Lavender
- Cookies & Cream

I didn't understand the wait time until I saw them freshly pack up my donuts straight from the fryer. Ooooh, it smelled so good. The paper bag felt warm and I quickly took one out for that first bite. First of all, I am not a donut fan, secondly, donuts that are cake form are usually not my fave because it's too dense & dry. This was anything but. I am totally in love with these donuts. Dare I say it? I like these better than Beiler's.

Luckily, we received both...our server was professional, efficient and non-invasive...the perfect combination! The food was well prepared, presented and I ordered ""the best breaded chicken sandwich"". What made it so incredible was the lightness of the bread and tenderness of the chicken!

CgWbON8IeLa1pRZQ8Th7Bg,T4LfF6fT4_5UuP6ZpMjUGQ,5,79,"First off I want to thank whoever's idea it was to have a free parking garage because that was nice! Though they do have valet too for $5 if you prefer. Another tip if you are coming on a Friday or Saturday night, make a reservation if you expect to sit indoors. We arrived rather early because we came for happy hour, and they said all the tables in the dining room were reserved already so there was only outside seating available on the patio. Which we didn't mind but it would be good to know ahead of time.

I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised with how good and flavorful the food was! I came with three girlfriends and we all ordered different tapas and shared so everyone could try everything. We pretty much ordered one of everything on the menu LOL. I definitely recommend this style when coming here. The happy hour is great because it's 50% off everything from 5-7PM, everyday!! 

They have three different sangrias and of course I had to try them all, you know to be thorough for yelp. They have a red, white, and a beer sangria. Though I prefer red wine to white, my favorite of the three was the white sangria. It was so fresh and fruity and delicious. 

The food: 
Assorted warm olives- yummy mixture of salty and spicy! Some tasted like they were soaked in jalapeño juice. 
Tomato bruschetta- so simple yet surprisingly delicious! It could use a pinch of salt and pepper but the crostini it's on was so buttery. 
Assortment of meats and cheese- not sure the kind my friend ordered but good, comes with nuts 
Jamon croquettas- would pass next time, texture is kind of like mashed potatoes inside, didn't see any ham I think they purée it.
Tuna tartare- MY FAVORITE thing we tried. Comes with mini taco shells to build a tuna taco. This tastes way better than it looks. 
Stuffed piquillo peppers- also very good and filling. Yummy bechamel sauce for dipping. 
Patatas bravas- really good. I'm all about the sauce and they did not skimp here. 
Tequenos- pretty much rolled fried cheese- it was ok but would not get again. Plain. 
Pullpo a la Gallega- steamed Spanish octopus over potatoes- did not care for this one. Octopus was over cooked. 
Gazpacho soup- did not try but friend liked it
Huevos Bulla- potato chips with eggs, ham and truffle oil. Interesting but wouldn't order again. The runny egg yolks made these chips soggy. 
Churrasco Muruno- my friend liked it, I'm not a steak fan but tried her sweet potatoes and they were delicious! Some of the best I've ever had.

vmi_GnDsGGPEJyhLi4Jj6A,hUmHwBQtGg0iH-PZakQJDw,5,63,"Noted as one of the best new restaurants in the area slash the COUNTRY, according to Bon Appetit, I figured I had to get in on the action during one of my many trips to Philadelphia. Managed to score a 6pm reservation on a Sunday, which was perfect. I'm not unfamiliar with the Italian joints in Philadelphia, and I was intrigued with the different offerings. Although I'm still confused as to whether I should pronounce the ""Wm"" part of the restaurant name.

The space is very elegant, with a lot of wood finishing and exposed brick. We were whisked to a room that looked similar to someone's living room, complete with a fireplace and large windows. Pretty cool, and it's interesting to see that there are more and more great restaurants coming to the Northern Philly area. 

What we ordered:
- Hamachi crudo: Really nice with the citrus notes, and the pistachio added a bit of crunch to the texture. It's always nice to see a good cut of raw fish at an Italian restaurant, and I'm glad that more and more Italian restaurants are starting to do this.
- Messinesi: Sort of like a longer version of macaroni, the sweet sausage ragout it came with and the ricotta all went very well together. 
- Speck & Egg pizza: One of the best pizzas I've ever had. I don't use that term lightly, but it was close to perfect execution, in my opinion. The crust was crispy but with slightly enough chew to it, and it came loaded with potatoes, caramelized onions, plenty of speck, and the runny egg on top was amazing.
- Veal cheeks: Super velvety and rich, and the meat was just the right tenderness, complemented well with the firmer rutabaga ""gnocchi"" underneath. 

Service was excellent throughout the meal, and our server gave excellent recommendations course by course. The value is excellent, as everything we had was top-notch, so you can be assured that you're getting a great dish no matter what.

Overall, an excellent experience, and easily one of the best restaurants I've been to in Philadelphia.

With a sophisticated menu, the main focus is on meatless dishes for all to enjoy.  The ingredients are locally sourced from five local farms making this place a must visit. Lovely presentation with its vegan, gluten free and organic garnishing with edible flowers and delicious sauces. Classy dinner? That's what you can expect here.

The burger arrived hot and I couldn't wait to make it disappear. I wasted no time and took a nice bite after I placed my napkin in my lap. I enjoyed it very much as it was perfectly seasoned with love--also activating enzymes and made in the most unexpected way. 

I only wish they had a gluten free option for the buns but otherwise a lovely dinner experience. The service was wonderful and the restaurant was clean. If you want fresh and locally sourced healthy food look no further as they make eating healthy so easy.

It was plated just perfectly!  There were 2 large triangular shaped items that looked like they were baked.  That was the cheese grits cakes.  They were fantastic.

Sticking out of a grit cake was a skewer of grilled shrimp.  They tasted so wonderful I could have eaten more.

The Drum fish was cooked perfectly and tasted great.  I loved the creole mustard hollandaise. It was drizzled over everything on the plate.  Yummy!

The pig-candy bacon came with 2 slices of perfectly cooked bacon covered in a heavenly coat of sugar candy goodness.  You need to get a side of this it's that good.

RNWrDF8G2gt91L5k-5IAMw,qDEcJ48kXdWxQGZefgG94w,5,59,"Sun Yu Si Kao is now my favorite Szechuan restaurant in Philadelphia Chinatown. Not only is the food superlative, but the house is beautifully designed with high ceilings, stone accented walls, unusual rope lighting and attractive serving dishes. It's great to see Ctown dress up and show its more sophisticated side in the hot, spicy and numbing world of Chengdu cuisine. 

We ordered seven dishes for the two of us, with enough to take home for the rest of the family. Allow me to enumerate:

* Sliced Beef & Tripe w Chili Sauce - Served cold but loaded with high temperature chilis, it was a great starting point. The textures of thin firm beef and loose tripe and the prickly feel of chili beginning the night of hotter and hotter choices;

* Takoyaki - Try to imagine whipped squid shaped into large marble sized balls. Creamy, yet definitely crustacean; slightly sweet, but also mildly fishy and sticky on the teeth. Very unusual, but surprisingly tasty;

* Spicy Shredded Beef - Tender mixed with pepper, onion, sprout,  Szechuan reds and a smattering of black  peppercorn and light film of chili oil, all of which continued to raise the Celsius in our mouths;

* Cumin Lamb Chops - The star of the show. Eight baby chops grilled and covered in more hot peppers, with bone wrapped in foil for ease of handling. Absolutely delicious enough to allow us to ignore the growing conflagration in the quest to strip every morsel of lamb from the finger width bone. Simply amazing; 

* Pan Seared Green Shishito Pepper - Beautiful rich shiny green. An explosive pleasure to consume. These boys appeared to have an inner glow, and were as burning hot as they were gorgeous to behold. They may be an acquired taste, but thankfully I have acquired it;

* Spicy Sliced Fish - White fish fillets is a large sculpted iron cauldron full of multiple peppers, including black peppercorns for numbing anesthetic effect on the tongue and gums, black fungus and sprouts in a deeply fired near molten liquid that both punished and delighted. 

Sure, there is a degree of masochism to loving Szechuanese food, but once the burn subsides as it always does, the full capsaicin rush can be fully appreciated as a successful challenge to the senses that grows on you. 

Overcome and carry on.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1cf54dc13e8c0e186b""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Chinese, Seafood, Hot Pot, Restaurants"",""business_id"":""qDEcJ48kXdWxQGZefgG94w"",""name"":""Xun Yu Si Kao""}]"
AIn3o2xaVLe5Ed0T_9zDaw,EwYzIWSC-w81qZwUwVDoIQ,5,104,"Old school Italian Gem in Lawrenceville!  If your looking for authentic Italian cuisine this is your place!  It's well worth the drive as these type of restaurants in NJ are sparse.  This restaurant is an almost an hour south from me, but I have no problem making another trip for delicious authentic Italian food like my grandma from Sicily would cook for me.  Enzo's was everything I'd hope it would be, but even better!  I started with the eggplant rollatini, and it was hands down one of the best eggplant rollatini I ever ate!  It's a must order here!  I was debating between a few different entrees as there was such a large selection here, and I decided to go with a dish I couldn't get anywhere in my area.  I picked the homemade tagliatelle with braised chicken, figs, and walnuts.  It's an authentic Italian dish my grandma made, but I haven't found it at any restaurant since dining here tonight.  I absolutely loved it!  I also ordered a side of meatballs which I enjoyed too!  For dessert I had the white chocolate and blueberry bread pudding, and it was very good!  I would recommend they make the sauce on top a touch more sweeter for it to be even more delicious.  Nonetheless, I'd still order it again!  There was only one thing disappointing about tonight.  I ordered a s'mores cookie to take home and it was hard and dry.  I'm not sure if I would of had it at the restaurant if it was suppose to be warmed up to taste good.  I'd inquire about it before I order the s'mores cookie.  I highly recommend dining at Enzo's in Lawrenceville!  I'd make the hour trip to dine here again in a heartbeat!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1cf54dc13e8c0e22b7""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Local Flavor, Italian, Seafood, Pizza, Restaurants"",""business_id"":""EwYzIWSC-w81qZwUwVDoIQ"",""name"":""Enzo's La Piccola Cucina""}]"

I chose Tacos Cancun because I desired good Mexican cuisine in a safe space respecting Covid Protocol. Just so happened that the back patio had been recently renovated - replacing beach umbrellas with a large lime green tarpaulin over all the tables and a 6' bamboo screen all around. It made the backyard feel private and someplace more tropical than New Jersey. That I was the only paying customer late Sunday afternoon, certainly helped with the vibe. I took a table along the southern wall about halfway back and had all the attention I could ever want. 

The menu had most of the usual suspects, plus a few house specialties. Although I was considering Flautas, Chili Rellenos, or Torta Milanese, when I arrived, I changed my mind for a walk on the wild side and ordered La Gringa, one of their specials that seemed to cover a lot of bases (sauteed veggies, ham, chorizo, melted cheese and crema drizzle). It was well reviewed, so I rolled with the optimistic sense I came in with. 

Within 10 minutes a large white ceramic plate arrived, with Red Rice & Black Beans and hot Tortillas. It was all delicious, even though I didn't understand why the dish was called ""Gringa,"" (North American Girl). No doubt there was a story there, but the servers didn't seem to know it. Even without the additional local color, it was a fine filling meal. It wasn't overly spicy, but not everything has to be a conflagration for me to be happy. 

While not as intensely authentic as the kitchens found in the Hispanic neighborhoods of Trenton or Norristown, it was plenty good enough for me. No hesitation coming again.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c19f54dc13e8c0df24a""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Mexican"",""business_id"":""Fv1OvtX40OUzaDL0P1itsw"",""name"":""Tacos Cancun""}]"
Ty1XcxqgZ-YFusQsA030lA,QpAVPiH1Yujksd_ReL-x-g,5,85,"Inca's is such a great gem in Tucson!  We came here with our Peruvian friend who guided us in ordering his favorite dishes.  Coming from someone who grew up on this cuisine, he assured us that everything we ate was authentic or at least very, very close!  He was even able to explain to us in detail how each of the dishes were cooked.  The portions were generous and we were able to share the plates family style.

For drinks we had a pitcher of the chicha morada (non-alcoholic purple maize drink), and traditional pisco sours which were incredibly strong!  We started with the anticuchos (chicken heart appetizer).  I was very wary to try this one, but it ended up being my favorite dish.  The texture of the meat was indistinguishable from dark meat.  I loved the spicy garnish and the fried potatoes on the side. 

For entrees, we had the lomo saltado mixto, arroz con mariscos (essentially paella), ceviche, and another ceviche-like dish.  Everything was delectable and filling but I'd recommend the seafood dishes the most.  I was pleased to taste really bold and eccentric flavors in every bite.

Service was attentive and we especially appreciated that our server was enthusiastic to give us his personal recommendations.  It was a wonderful experience and I'm certain we will back again!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c19f54dc13e8c0df292""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Peruvian, Seafood, Latin American"",""business_id"":""QpAVPiH1Yujksd_ReL-x-g"",""name"":""Inca's Peruvian Cuisine""}]"

We decided to meet at this breakfast mecca called Biscuit Love, also known as Biscuit Love Brunch, to see what all the hype was about. This Music City locally sourced biscuit based staple has been  serving Southern scratch-made breakfast, lunch and brunch daily for over 6 years using flaky, buttery biscuits hot out of the oven, as a vehicle to deliver everything from donuts to grits to biscuits to eggs to salads to burgers. Humbly nourishing lives, stomachs and souls, this family business born in the South, was transformed from a borrowed truck to a silver bullet Airstream to a now open & airy white brick and mortar eatery with a streamlined yet vintage inspired decor. Successfully attracting a mixture of neighborhood urbanites and tourists with non traditional ingredients in the most whimsical & playful way..BLB is bringing modern day comfort fare to the hungry and hungover in the thriving, trendy and renovated Gulch...all while supporting local farmers & artisans and actively giving back to the Nashville community. Our breakfast started with a shared plate of Bonuts...fried pillowy biscuit dough, twirled in crystallized sugar, brimming with sweet & savory lemon mascarpone cheese and embellished with homemade blueberry compote. I ordered a colossal customer favorite breakfast sandwich called the East Nasty...a hot & flaky buttermilk biscuit, succulent fried boneless chicken thigh, creamy aged cheddar, savory sausage gravy and topped with a farm fresh perfectly fried egg...Fun Fact: also named the best sandwich in America by Bon 
Appétit. You can also find on the board a plethora of refreshing beverages including hand squeezed juices, hot Muletown Roasted Coffee, handcrafted cocktails and cold regional beer.

The holidays are upon us and what better way than to get in the holiday spirit by checking out Pearl Social's Miracle Pop-up! 

I made reservations to check out their soft opening, but they officially open on November 22nd. So plan ahead and make your reservation on their website. This is a pop-up you can't miss! 

There is a time limit depending on how many people are in your party. We were a party of 3 and I believe our time limit was 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Funny thing is they will give you a cute card (see my pic) letting you know you have 15 minutes left until your time is up! I thought that was creative and a nice way to kick you out lol. 

When you enter this place you will feel like you just stepped into a Christmas wonderland. They really went all out here and did a great job at decorating the place. I didn't want to leave! This is the perfect place for a Yelp event (hint hint) lol.

The staff here is amazing and the bartenders did a great job serving up some festive cocktails. Shout out to Jason and Alberto for your awesome service. 

For drinks, I tried the SantaTaRex which was a little on the sweeter side for me, but still a good drink. It had blanco tequila, mezcal, melon liqueur, almond orgeat, lime and tiki bitters. 

The Christmas Carol Barrel won me over! Made with reposada tequila, coffee liqueur, dry curaçao, spiced chocolate, aromatic bitters, and orange bitters. It literally tasted like a chocolate Christmas drink. Loved it! 

I also sampled the Elfing Around. This was on the sweeter side due to the mulled wine, but still a nice holiday drink. 

Their drink menu has some creative holiday drinks and I especially dig the cute names. 

Overall, we had a great time here and I'm definitely coming back soon!","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c19f54dc13e8c0df186""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Restaurants, Pop-Up Restaurants, Bars, Cocktail Bars, Local Flavor, Nightlife"",""business_id"":""nhOMsw22-rz9kXSKwBZYAQ"",""name"":""Miracle At The Funk Zone""}]"
Pyuh2_2f4OGjVgCX_ZzpbA,vyOVT4bcW227LRwJGHTeSw,5,144,"Buena Onda is located in Santa Barbara and it is famed for their traditional Argentinian empanadas. You know...empanadas... a fried turnover pastry with sweet or savory filling. Well I got wind that they had a few vegan options, which gave me all the more reason to swing by. I arrived during the evening and when you walk in you can almost taste them in the air. There were two people ahead of me and a few behind me. I had already placed an order over the phone so once it was my turn I simply said the magic words and paid my bill. 

The options were vegana quinoa (peppers, spinach, quinoa, and vegan cream cheese) and Hakuna Batata (shallot, sweet potato yam, and spinach)--I ordered both. They also have meat empanadas and they are all oven baked to order. Both were quite delicious but of the two the Hakuna Batata stole the show--it means no worries, am I right or am I right? My order came with a herb/grassy olive oil dressing for the empanadas which was nice and I was quite full once I finished my meal. They have outdoor seating and twinkle lights for an elegant look. 

What I love about them is that they are authentic and organic. Their dough and fillings are housemade. You can purchase in bulk or family meals for a better deal. They also have frozen empanadas that you can take home and cook at your leisure. They even serve soups, salads, and desserts. After a few years the secret is out fresh and bake to order empanadas right here in sunny Santa Barbara. Thank you for making the world a little more wonderful.

517 Forest St, Reno, NV 89509
June 20, 2020 Saturday - 12:30 PM for lunch, dining in their parking lot
2 Adults

Atmosphere - 5 stars
Food - 5 stars
Service - 5 stars

Background - I love my Diners, Drive-In, and Dives, and I would consider this an alternate location.  I hope the boost from the show that filmed at the Mill Street location allowed them to open a new location.  But what really got me in was the Yelp's Community Manager, Michael.  He posted their Reno Restaurant Week menu on Yelp and Facebook.  A special menu, I am in!

Atmosphere - COVID is having an impact on the dining area.  Looking at the front of the place, right door is for ordering and the left door for pick.  You can see the dining high top tables are still set up but are not in use.  Tiny amount of space in both doors that allow you into the building.  The parking lot behind Old World Coffee has a seating area which we found a spot in the shade by ourselves.

Food 
  Lunch - They have a special menu for Reno Restaurant Week all about their burrito which they call Gnar.  Chorizo had me sold with Spanish Gnar, which also included goat cheese, fried egg, hash brown, roasted red pepper along with southwest sauce wrapped in a flour tortilla.  A beautiful burrito and just the right size for me.  The fried egg was at the end of my burrito.  It would have great to have that beautiful egg yolk explosion on both ends.  Sad that it will not be able to have this burrito for a while.

Service - I order from a lady after walking in the small space from the right door.  I ordered two of the RRW Burritos of Gnaria.  When she walked to the chef to place the verbal ordered she found out they did not have a gluten free wrap.  After trying to figure out what to do for my wife's lunch the chef found the proper wraps. I could hear she was having issues with the register adding the Gluten Free option for my wife.  Some help from the kitchen entered the information in so I could pay.  I did not know there was an up charge of a dollar of gluten free.  No biggie but that should have been explained when I ordered.  Wait outside near the left door.  Three level shelfing unit holds food for people.  Online orders, curbside, and others.  My order never made it to the shelf as it was being walked up my name was called out so I was able to obtain it from them.

Future - Yes, Great Food and Triple D make for a great combination.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0e04ae""},""stars"":""4.5"",""categories"":""Sandwiches, Restaurants, Delis, Breakfast & Brunch, Food, Food Delivery Services"",""business_id"":""RabHkk801rEIofZxuS8v9w"",""name"":""Full Belly Deli - Midtown""}]"
D4sUvo6PJ1itEzHAF1SAUA,OdIBX09glfXNVSyd0RnIeg,5,76,"No vow of silence can keep me quiet any longer about Monk's Cafe. This popular and packed Philadelphia pub inspires me to free myself of my worldly worries and physical possessions ... so that I can simply possess a Belgian Beer and Belgian Fries (Pommes Frites).

De Ranke XX Bitter Ale (Belgium - 6.0% ABV 60 IBU) was equally hoppy and refreshing. While getting a second round of beers, we shared an order of Monks Mussels that lived up to the flavor hype. Meanwhile, the Spanish Flies (Spicy Chicken Wings) didn't. Three out of the four of us love spicy hot food and were disappointed with the lack of kick from the wings. Regardless, the chicken was still yummy. 

It wasn't just me in Monk's that couldn't keep quiet either. The bar is seriously loud. This is not the spot for a peaceful Philly date or business meeting. Instead, Monk's Cafe is the place for hanging out with friends having a Belgian Beer, Belgian Fries, Monks Mussels, and Spanish Flies.

Even though monks have rules about love and such, I, personally, really loved Monk's Cafe. Overall, 4.5 stars rounded up for some good karma.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1cf54dc13e8c0e1cf1""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Nightlife, Pubs, Bars, Belgian, Restaurants, Gastropubs"",""business_id"":""OdIBX09glfXNVSyd0RnIeg"",""name"":""Monk's Cafe""}]"
t6Wa9V82AZ2M-GIYquUgng,skY6r8WAkYqpV7_TxNm23w,5,51,"I am honestly flabbergasted that I have not yet written a review for Hendry's/The Boathouse. No matter who you ask, this restaurant is bound to be mentioned when brunch options in Santa Barbara is discussed. Depending on who you ask, the name may change several times--especially since the actual beach's name is Arroyo Burro. This beach is what ""brings all the boys"", oh, and I suppose dog lovers too since the east half of the beach is pet-friendly.

Whenever I have visitors in town, I am always sure to bring them here for a scenic brunch. The restaurant is smack dab on the sand between two tall bluffs with endless windows and views of the Pacific Ocean and Channel Islands. If this isn't paradise, I don't know what is?! Weekends (Friday, Saturdays and Sundays) at Hendry's can be nuts, so I strongly advise everyone to visit either early right when they open or on a weekday to avoid a long wait. They do provide wireless pagers if you'd like to stroll the beach barefoot or hit up the shell staircase for elevated cliff views (located behind the restaurant to the west). It can be breezy so bring a light coat along since half the seating options are outdoors. There are heat lamps and a fire pit too. 

No matter what you order off the menu for breakfast you cannot go wrong: Chilaquiles, Crab Cake Benedict, Huevos Hope Rancheros, and the list of delicious options goes on... I also feel obligated to recommend Hendry's for their Breakfast Booze selection. Whether it be one their large variety of fruit-flavored mimosas (orange, grapefruit, blood orange, mango, and many more...), Espresso Martini (for when I need a morning caffeine kick), a Pancake Breakfast Shot (for those with a sweet tooth), ""I think I lost my headache"" Michelada (perfect hair of the dog), or Signature Bloody Mary (with a chilled prawn, applewood smoked bacon, pickled veg, and citrus; YES PLEASE!).

While I have been here for lunch and dinner, I have to admit that I think they do breakfast/brunch the best.

P/S: Shout-out to Jessica my favorite waitress!
Psst: You can also order a boozy beverage to-go to stroll along the beach whether or not you decide to dine here.","[{""_id"":{""$oid"":""63540c1af54dc13e8c0dfefa""},""stars"":""4"",""categories"":""Seafood, Restaurants, Hawaiian, American (New), Breakfast & Brunch"",""business_id"":""skY6r8WAkYqpV7_TxNm23w"",""name"":""Boathouse at Hendry's Beach""}]"
